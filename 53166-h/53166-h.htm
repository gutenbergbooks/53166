<div><span class='pageno' title='1' id='Page_1'></span><h1>CHAPTER I</h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;font-size:1em;'>THE BROOK</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'>D</span>ick and Dolly were twins and had been
twins for nine years.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Most of these years had been spent
with Grandma Banks and Aunt Helen, for Dick
and Dolly were orphaned when they were tiny
tots, and Aunt Helen Banks was their mother’s
sister.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, about two years ago, Grandma Banks
had died, and now Aunt Helen was to be married
and go far away across the sea to live.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So their Chicago home was broken up, and the
twins were sent to the old Dana homestead in
Connecticut, to live with their father’s people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This transfer of their dwelling-place didn’t
bother Dick and Dolly much, for they were
philosophical little people and took things just
as they happened, and, moreover, they were so
fond of each other, that so long as they were
together, it didn’t matter to them where they
were.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But to the two people who lived in the old
Dana place, and who were about to receive the
twin charges, it mattered a great deal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Rachel and Miss Abbie Dana were
maiden ladies of precise and methodical habits,
and to have their quiet home invaded by two
unknown children was, to say the least, disturbing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But then Dick and Dolly were the children of
their own brother, and so, of course they were
welcome, still the aunts felt sure it would make
a great difference in the household.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And indeed it did.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the moment of the twins’ arrival,—but
I may as well tell you about that moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>You see, Aunt Helen was so busy with her
wedding preparations that she didn’t want to
take the time to bring Dick and Dolly all the
way from Chicago to Heatherton, Connecticut,
so she sent them East in charge of some friends
of hers who chanced to be coming. Mr. and
Mrs. Halkett were good-natured people, and
agreed to see the twins safely to Dana Dene, the
home of the waiting aunts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the aunts were waiting somewhat
anxiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had never seen Dick and Dolly since
they were tiny babies, and as they had heard
vague reports of mischievous tendencies, they
feared for the peace and quiet of their uneventful
lives.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But,” said Miss Abbie to Miss Rachel, “we
can’t expect children to act like grown people.
If they’re only tidy and fairly good-mannered, I
shall be thankful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps we can train them to be,” responded
Miss Rachel, hopefully; “nine is not
very old, to begin with. I think they will be
tractable at that age.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us hope so,” said Miss Abbie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Dana ladies were not really old,—even
the family Bible didn’t credit them with quite
half a century apiece,—but they were of a quiet,
sedate type, and were disturbed by the least
invasion of their daily routine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Life at Dana Dene was of the clock-work
variety, and mistresses and servants fell into step
and trooped through each day, without a variation
from the pre-arranged line of march.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, to their honest souls, duty was pre-eminent,
even over routine, and now, as it was
clearly their duty to take their brother’s children
into their household, there was no hesitation,
but there was apprehension.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For who could say what two nine-year-olds
would be like?</p>

<p class='pindent'>But in accordance with their sense of duty,
the Misses Dana accepted the situation and
went to work to prepare rooms for the new-comers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two large sunny bedrooms, Dolly’s sweet and
dainty, Dick’s more boyish, were made ready,
and another large room was planned to be used
as a study or rainy-day playroom for them both.
Surely, the aunts were doing the right thing,—if
the children would only respond to the gentle
treatment, and not be perfect little savages, all
might yet be well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now it happened that when Mr. and Mrs.
Halkett reached New York with their young
charges, the trip from Chicago had made Mrs.
Halkett so weary and indisposed that she preferred
to remain in New York while her husband
took the twins to Heatherton. It was not
a long trip, perhaps three hours or less on the
train, so Mr. Halkett started off to fulfil his
trust and present Dick and Dolly at the door
of their new home, assuring his wife that he
would return on the first train possible after
accomplishing his errand. Mrs. Halkett took
pride in seeing that the children were very spick
and span, and prettily arrayed, and gave them
many injunctions to keep themselves so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sturdy Dick looked fine in his grey Norfolk
jacket and knickerbockers, with wide white collar
and correct tie. Pretty little Dolly was in
white piqué, very stiff and clean, with a tan-coloured
coat and flower-trimmed hat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The twins looked alike, and had the same
big, dark eyes, but Dick’s hair was a dark mass
of close-cropped curls, while Dolly’s was a tangle
of fluffy golden ringlets. This striking effect of
fair hair and dark eyes made her an unusually
attractive-looking child, and though they had
never thought of it themselves, the twins were a
very beautiful pair of children. Docilely obedient
to Mrs. Halkett’s injunctions, they sat
quietly in the train, and did nothing that could
by any possibility be termed naughty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Truth to tell, they were a little awed at the
thought of the two aunts, whom they did not
yet know, but had every reason to believe were
not at all like Auntie Helen. They chatted together,
as they looked out of the window at the
landscape and stations, and Mr. Halkett read
his paper, and then looked over his timetable
to see how soon he could get back to New
York.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a train that left Heatherton for
New York about half an hour after their own
arrival, so he hoped he could leave the twins
at Dana Dene and return to the metropolis on
that train. But owing to a delay of some
sort they did not reach the Heatherton station
until about twenty minutes after schedule
time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the train Mr. Halkett desired to take
back to New York, there was no other for two
hours, and greatly annoyed was that gentleman.
When they stood at last on the station platform,
a pleasant-faced Irishman approached and informed
Mr. Halkett that he was from Dana
Dene, and had been sent to meet Master Dick
and Miss Dolly. As the man appeared so capable
and responsible, Mr. Halkett was tempted
to put the children in his care, and return himself
at once to New York.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He explained about the trains, and told of
his wife’s illness, and the intelligent Michael said
at once:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shure, sor, do yez go back to New York.
I’ll be afther takin’ the childher safe to the
house. Don’t yez moind, sor, but go right
along. Lave all to me, sor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Impressed with the man’s decisive words,
and sure of his trustworthiness, Mr. Halkett
assisted the children into the carriage, and
bidding them good-bye turned back to the
station.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly looked a little wistful as he turned
away, for though no relative, he had been a kind
friend, and now she felt like a stranger in a
strange land.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Dick was with her, so nothing else really
mattered. She slipped her hand in her brother’s,
and then Michael picked up his reins and they
started off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was early May, and it chanced to be warm
and pleasant. The carriage was an open one, a
sort of landau, and the twins gazed around
with eager interest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Great, isn’t it, Dolly?” exclaimed Dick, as
they drove along a winding road, with tall trees
and budding shrubs on either side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes!” returned Dolly. “It’s beautiful.
I love the country a whole heap better than
Chicago. Oh, Dick, there’s woods,—real
woods!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So it is, and a brook in it! I say, Michael,
can’t we get out here a minute?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think not,” said the good-natured coachman.
“The leddies is forninst, lookin’ for yez,
and by the same token, we’re afther bein’ late
as it is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I know,” said Dick, “but we won’t
stay a minute. Just let us run in and see that
brook. It’s such a dandy! I never saw a brook
but once or twice in all my life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yez didn’t! The saints presarve us!
Wherever have yez lived?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the city,—in Chicago. Do stop a minute,
please, Michael.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please, Michael,” added Dolly, and her
sweet voice and coaxing glance were too much
for Michael’s soft heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grumbling a little under his breath, he pulled
up his horses, and let the children get out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just a minute, now,” he said, warningly.
“I’ll bring yez back here some other day. Can
yez get under the brush there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll go over,” cried Dick, as he climbed
and scrambled over a low thicket of brush.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly scrambled through, somehow, and the
two children that emerged on the other side of
the brush were quite different in appearance
from the two sedate-looking ones that Mr.
Halkett had left behind him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dick’s white collar had received a smudge,
his stocking was badly torn, and his cheek
showed a long scratch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly’s white frock was a sight! Her pretty
tan coat had lost a button or two, and her hat
was still in the bushes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hey, Doddy, hey, for the brook!” shouted
Dick, and grasping each other’s hands, they ran
for the rippling water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!” cried Dolly, her eyes shining. “Did
you <span class='it'>ever</span>!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To the very edge of the brook they went,
dabbling their fingers in the clear stream, and
merrily splashing water on each other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All this would have been a harmless performance
enough if they had been in play clothes,
but the effect on their travelling costumes was
most disastrous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Leaning over the mossy bank to reach the
water caused fearful green stains on white piqué
and on light-grey knickerbockers. Hands became
grimy, and faces hot and smudgy. But
blissfully careless of all this, the children
frolicked and capered about, rejoiced to find the
delightful country spot and quite oblivious to
the fact that they were on their way to their
new home.</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='cool'></a>“Let’s wade,” said Dick, and like a flash,
off came four muddy shoes, and four grass-greened
stockings. Oh, how good the cool ripply
water did feel! and how they chuckled with glee
as they felt the wavelets plashing round their
ankles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Across the brook were the dearest wild flowers,—pink,
yellow, and white.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We must gather some,” said Dolly. “Can
we wade across?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yep; I guess so. It doesn’t look deep.
Come on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Taking hands again, they stepped cautiously,
and succeeded in crossing the shallow brook,
though, incidentally, well dampening the piqué
skirt, and the grey knickerbockers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sitting down on the mossy bank, they picked
handfuls of the flowers and wondered what they
were.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hollo! Hollo!” called Michael’s voice
from the road, where he sat holding his
horses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, Michael! In a minute,” shrilled
back the childish voices.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And they really meant to go in a minute, but
the fascination of the place held them, and they
kept on picking flowers, and grubbing among the
roots and stones at the edge of the water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We really ought to go,” said Dolly.
“Come on, Dick. Oh, look at the birds!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A large flock of birds flew low through the
sky, and as they circled and wheeled, the children
watched them eagerly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re birds coming North for the summer,”
said Dick. “See those falling behind!
They don’t like the way the flock is going, and
they’re going to turn back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So they are! We must watch them. There,
now they’ve decided to go on, after all! Aren’t
they queer?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hollo! Hollo! Come back, yez bad
childher! Come back, I say!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Michael, in a minute,” rang out Dolly’s
sweet, bird-like voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In a minute, nothin’! Come now, roight
sthraight away! Do yez hear?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, we’re coming,” answered Dick, and together
they started to wade back across the
brook.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then there were shoes and stockings to be
put on, and with sopping wet feet, and no towels,
this is not an easy task.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They tugged at the unwilling stockings and
nearly gave up in despair, but succeeded at last
in getting them on, though the seams were
far from the proper straight line at the back.
Shoes were not so hard to put on, but were impossible
to button without a buttonhook, so had
to remain unbuttoned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meantime, Michael was fairly fuming with
angry impatience. He could not leave his
horses, or he would have gone after the truants,
and no passers-by came along whom he could
ask to hold his restive team.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So he continued to shout, and Dick and Dolly
continued to assure him that they were coming,
but they didn’t come.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last they appeared at the thicket hedge,
and as the two laughing faces peeped through,
Michael could scarcely recognise his young
charges. Torn, soiled, dishevelled, unkempt,
there was absolutely no trace of the spick and
span toilets Mrs. Halkett had looked after so
carefully, in spite of her aching head and tired
nerves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yez naughty little rascals!” cried Michael.
“Whativer possessed yez to tousel yersilves up
loike that! Shame to yez! What’ll yer aunties
say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the first time, the twins realised their
disreputable appearance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What, indeed, would their new aunties say
to them? Aunt Helen would have laughed, in
her pretty, merry way, and sent them trotting
away to clean up, but with new and untried
aunties they couldn’t be sure. Moreover, they
had an idea that Aunt Rachel and Aunt Abbie
were not at all like pretty, young Auntie Helen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rescuing her hat from the thorn bush where
it hung, Dolly looked ruefully at its twisted
flowers. The more she tried to pull them into
shape, the worse they looked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She put it on her head, dismayed meanwhile
to find her broad hair-ribbon was gone, and
her sunny curls a moist, tangled mop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dick was conscious of a growing feeling of
wrong-doing, but there was nothing to be done
but face the music.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get in,” he said, briefly to his sister, and
they clambered into the carriage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Michael said no more; it was not his place
to reprimand the children of the house, but he
sat up very straight and stiff, as he drove rapidly
toward home. To be sure, his straightness and
stiffness was to conceal a fit of merriment caused
by the thought of presenting these ragamuffins at
the portals of Dana Dene, but the ragamuffins
themselves didn’t know that, and regretful and
chagrined, they sat hand in hand, awaiting their
fate.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='15' id='Page_15'></span><h1>CHAPTER II</h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;font-size:1em;'>THE ARRIVAL</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'>I</span>n the dark and somewhat sombre library
at Dana Dene, Miss Rachel and Miss Abbie
sat awaiting their guests. The room might
have been called gloomy, but for the sunshine
that edged in through the long, narrow, slit-like
windows, and made determined golden bars
across the dark-red carpet. Both the Misses
Dana showed clearly their anxiety to have the
children arrive and end their suspense.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If only they’re tidy children,” said Miss
Rachel for the fiftieth time; and Miss Abbie
responded, as she always did, “Yes, and quiet-mannered.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Rachel Dana was of rather spare build,
and sharp features. Her brown hair, only
slightly tinged with grey, was deftly arranged,
and every curled lock in its right place. Her
pretty house-dress of dark blue foulard silk, with
white figures, was modishly made and carefully
fitted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Abbie was a little more plump, and her
gown was of a shade lighter blue, though otherwise
much like her sister’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ladies had a patient air, as if they had
waited long, but though they now and then
glanced at the clock, they expressed no surprise
at the delayed arrival. Trains were apt to be
late at Heatherton, and they knew Michael
would return as soon as possible. They had not
gone themselves to the station to meet the twins,
for it had seemed to them more dignified and
fitting to receive their young relatives in their
own home. Meantime, the young relatives were
drawing nearer, and now, quite forgetting their
own untidy appearance, their thoughts had
turned to the waiting aunts, and the welcome
they would probably receive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t believe they’ll be as nice as Aunty
Helen,” said Dick, candidly, “but I hope they’ll
be jolly and gay.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope they’ll like us,” said Dolly, a little
wistfully. She had always missed a mother’s
love more than Dick had, and her affectionate
little heart hoped to find in these aunties a certain
tenderness that merry Aunt Helen had
not possessed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dick eyed his sister critically. “I don’t believe
they will,” he said, honestly, “until we
get some clean clothes on. I say, Dollums, we
look like scarecrows.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So we do!” said Dolly, fairly aghast as she
realised the state of her costume. “Oh, Dick,
can’t we get dressed up before we see them?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“’Course we can’t. Our trunks and bags
haven’t come yet; and, anyway, they’ll probably
be on the porch or somewhere, to meet us.
Buck up, Dolly; don’t you mind. You’re just
as nice that way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is my face dirty?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not so much dirty,—as red and scratched.
How <span class='it'>did</span> you get so chopped up?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was those briers. You went over, but I
went through.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should say you did! Well, I don’t believe
they’ll mind your looks. And, anyway, they’ll
have to get used to it; you ’most always look
like that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was cold comfort, and Dolly’s feminine
heart began to feel that their appearance would
be greatly in their disfavour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she was of a sanguine nature, and, too,
she was apt to devise expedients.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll tell you, Dick,” she said, as an idea came
to her; “you know, ‘a soft answer turneth
away wrath’; no,—I guess I mean ‘charity
covereth a multitude of sins.’ Yes, that’s it.
And charity is love, you know. So when we
see the aunties, let’s spring into their arms and
kiss ’em and love ’em ’most to death, and then
they won’t notice our clothes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, that goes. Let me see,—yes,
your face is clean,”—Dick made a dab or
two at it with his handkerchief. “How’s
mine?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, it’s clean,” said Dolly, “at least, there
aren’t any smudges; but you’d better wash it
before supper.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, I will. Here we go now, turning
in at the gate. Be ready to jump out and fly
at them if they’re on the porch.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They weren’t on the porch, so the twins went
in at the great front door, which was opened for
them by a smiling maid, whose smile broadened
as she saw them. Then, repressing her smile,
she ushered them to the library door and into the
presence of the two waiting aunts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now!” whispered Dick, and with a mad
rush, the two flew across the room like whirlwinds
and fairly <span class='it'>banged</span> themselves into the
arms of Miss Rachel and Miss Abbie Dana.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This sudden onslaught was followed by a
series of hugs and kisses which were of astonishing
strength and duration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What Miss Rachel and Miss Abbie thought
can never be known, for they had no power of
thought. Victims of a volcanic visitation do not
think,—at least, not coherently, and the Dana
ladies were quite helpless, both mentally and
physically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear Auntie,” cooed Dolly, patting the
cheek of the one she had attacked, though not
knowing her name; “are you glad to see us?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Rachel stared stupidly at her, but the
stare was not reassuring, and Dolly’s heart
fell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jolly glad to get here,” cried Dick, loyally
trying to carry out Dolly’s plan, as he nearly
choked the breath out of the other aunt. Miss
Abbie had a little more sense of humour than
her sister,—though neither of them was over-burdened
with it,—so she said to Dick:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then do stop pommeling me, and stand off
where I can see what you look like!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But this was just what Dick was not anxious
to do. So he only clung closer, and said, “Dear
Auntie, which is your name?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m your Aunt Abbie,” was the response,
not too gently given, “and now stand up, if you
please, and stop these monkey-tricks!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of course, since she put it that way, Dick
had to desist, and he released his struggling aunt,
and bravely stood up for inspection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Rachel, too, had pushed Dolly away
from her, and the twins stood, hand in hand,
waiting for the verdict. It was an awful moment.
The physical exertion of the manner they
had chosen of greeting their aunts had made
their flushed little faces still redder, and the
scratches stood out in bold relief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Also, their soiled and torn garments looked
worse in this elegantly appointed room even
than they had in the woods or in the carriage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Altogether the twins felt that their plan of
defence had failed, and they were crestfallen,
shy, homesick, and pretty miserable all ’round.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the funny part was, that the plan hadn’t
failed. Though the aunts never admitted it,
both their hearts were softened by the feeling of
those little arms round their necks, and those
vigorous, if grimy kisses that fell, irrespectively,
on their cheeks, necks, or lace collars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Had it not been for this tornado of affection,
the greeting would have been far different. But
one cannot speak coldly to a guest who shows
such warmth of demonstration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you <span class='it'>are</span> a pretty-looking pair!” exclaimed
Miss Rachel, veiling her real disapproval
behind a semblance of jocularity. “Do
you always travel in ragged, dirty clothes?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Aunt Rachel,” said Dick, feeling he
must make a strike for justice; “at least, we
don’t start out this way. But you see, we had
hardly ever seen a brook before——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And it was so lovely!” put in Dolly, ecstatically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And wild flowers to it!” cried Dick, his
eyes shining with the joy of the remembrance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And pebbly stones!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And ripply water!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And birds, flying in big bunches!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, but it was splendid!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And so you went to the brook,” said Aunt
Rachel, beginning to see daylight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes’m; on the way up from the station, you
know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did Michael go with you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; he sat and held the horses, and hollered
for us to come back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why didn’t you go when he called you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, we did; at least, we went in a minute.
But, Aunt Rachel, we never had seen a real live
brook before, not since we were little bits of
kiddy-wids,—and we just couldn’t bear to leave
it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We waded in it!” said Dolly, almost solemnly,
as if she had referred to the highest
possible earthly bliss.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Dana ladies were nonplussed. True, the
affection showered on them had tempered their
<a id='sev'></a>severity, yet now justice began to reassert itself,
and surely it would not be just or fair to
have these semi-barbaric children installed at
Dana Dene.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did your aunt in Chicago let you act like
this?” asked Aunt Abbie, by way of trying to
grasp the situation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you see, there never was a brook
there,” said Dick, pleasantly. “Only Lake
Michigan, and that was too big to be any
fun.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, isn’t Heatherton lovely?” exclaimed
Dolly, her big, dark eyes full of rapture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had again possessed herself of Miss
Rachel’s hand and was patting it, and incidentally
transfering some “good, brown earth” to
it, from her own little paw.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Though Dolly had planned their mode of entrance,
she had forgotten all about it now, and
her affectionate demonstrations were prompted
only by her own loving little heart, and not by
an effort to be tactful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In her enthusiasm over the beautiful country-side,
she fairly bubbled over with love and affection
for all about her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you both so fond of the country, then?”
said Miss Abbie, a little curiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, we love it,” declared Dick, “and we’ve
’most never seen it. Auntie Helen always liked
fashionable places in summer, and of course in
winter we were in Chicago.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And we were naughty,” said Dolly, with a
sudden burst of contrition, “to go wading in
the brook in our good clothes. Mrs. Halkett
told us <span class='it'>’spressly</span> not to get soiled or even rumpled
before we saw you. And we’re sorry we
did,—but, oh! that brook! When can we go
there again? To-morrow?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Or this afternoon,” said Dick, sidling up
to Aunt Rachel; “it isn’t late, is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The twins had instinctively discerned that
Miss Rachel was the one of whom to ask permission.
Aunt Abbie seemed more lovable, perhaps,
but without a doubt Aunt Rachel was the
fixer of their fate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This afternoon! I should say not!” exclaimed
Miss Rachel. “It’s nearly supper time
now, and how you’re going to be made presentable
is more than I know! Have you any other
clothes?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In our trunks,—lots of ’em,” said Dick,
cheerfully. “But these are our best ones. Mrs.
Halkett put them on us purpose to come to you.
I’m sorry they’re smashed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dick’s sorrow was expressed in such blithe
and nonchalant tones, that Miss Rachel only
smiled grimly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you hungry?” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No’m,” said Dick, slowly, and Dolly added,
“Not <span class='it'>very</span>. Of course we’re always <span class='it'>some</span> hungry.
But Aunt Rachel, can’t we go out and
scoot round the yard? Just to see what it’s like,
you know. Of course, this room is,—beautiful,
but we do love to be out doors. May we?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Miss Rachel, decidedly, and
though Miss Abbie said, timidly, “Why don’t
you let them?” the elder sister resumed:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go out on my lawn looking like that? Indeed
you can’t! I’d be ashamed to have the
chickens see you,—let alone the servants!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, are there chickens?” cried Dolly, dancing
about in excitement. “I’m <span class='it'>so</span> glad we’re
going to live here!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She made a movement as if to hug her Aunt
Rachel once again, but as she saw the involuntary
drawing away of that lady’s shoulders, she transferred
her caress to Dick, and the tattered twins
fell on each other’s necks in mutual joy of anticipation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are a ridiculous pair of children,” said
Aunt Abbie, laughing at the sight; “but as I
hope you’ll show some of your father’s traits,
you may improve under our training.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If we can train such hopeless cases,” said
Miss Rachel. “Has nobody ever taught you
how to behave?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Dick, growing red at the implication.
“Auntie Helen is a lovely lady, and
she taught us to be honourable and polite.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, she did! and do you call it honourable
to go off wading in your best clothes, while
we were waiting for you to come here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dick’s honest little face looked troubled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know,” he said, truly, but Dolly,
who was often the quicker-witted of the two,
spoke up:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It may have been naughty, Aunt Rachel,
but I don’t ’zackly think it was dishonourable.
Do you?” Thus pinned down, Miss Rachel
considered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps ‘dishonourable’ isn’t quite the right
word,” she said, “but we won’t discuss that now.
I shall teach you to behave properly, of course,
but we won’t begin until you look like civilised
beings, capable of being taught. Just now, I
think hot baths, with plenty of soap, will be the
best thing for you, but as you have no clean
clothes, you’ll have to go to bed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At five o’clock! Whew!” said Dick. “Oh,
I say, Aunt Rachel, not to bed!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anyway, let us go for a tear around the
yard first,” begged Dolly. “We can’t hurt
these clothes now; and I don’t believe the
chickens will mind. Are there <span class='it'>little</span> chickens,
Aunt Abbie?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, little woolly yellow ones.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Like the ones on Easter souvenirs? Oh,
<span class='it'>please</span> let us see them now,—<span class='it'>please</span>!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>More persuaded by the violence of her niece’s
plea than by her own inclination, Miss Rachel
said they might go out for half an hour, and then
they must come in to baths and beds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And supper?” asked Dick, hopefully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, bread and milk after you’re clean and
tucked into bed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Only</span> bread and milk?” said Dolly, with
eyes full of wheedlesomeness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, perhaps jam,” said Aunt Abbie, smiling,
and somehow her smile augured even more
than jam. Out they scampered then, and soon
found Michael, who introduced them to the
chickens and also to Pat, who was the gardener.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I like you,” said Dolly, slipping her little
hand into Pat’s big one, both being equally
grimy. “Please show us all the flowers and
things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was so much to look at, they could
only compass a small part of it in their allotted
half-hour. Dana Dene covered about thirty
acres, but it was not a real farm. A vegetable
garden supplied the household wants, and the
rest of the estate was park and flower beds and
a bit of woods and an orchard and a terrace,
and the poultry yard and stables, and other delights
of which the children could only guess.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aren’t you glad we came?” said Dolly,
still hanging on to Pat’s hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I—I guess so, Miss,” he replied, cautiously;
“but I can’t say yet, for sure. Ye’re rampageous,
I’m afraid. Ain’t ye, now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Dick, who was always honest, “I
think we are. At least, everybody says so. But,
Pat, we’re going to try not to make you any
trouble.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, that’s a good boy. If ye talk like that,
you ’n me’ll be friends.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly said nothing, but she smiled happily
up into Patrick’s kind eyes, and then, with their
usual adaptability to circumstances, the twins
began to feel at home.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;font-size:1em;'>AN EARLY STROLL</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'>S</span>oon after daybreak next morning, Dolly
woke, and surveyed with satisfaction her
pretty room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pink roses clambered over the wall paper, and
over the chintz hangings and furniture, and over
the soft, dainty bed-coverlet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was much more attractive than her room
at Aunt Helen’s, and as Dolly loved pretty
things, she gave a little sigh of content and
nestled comfortably into her pillows. Then
she heard Dick’s voice whispering through the
closed door between their rooms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hi, Dolly; I say! Aren’t you up yet?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, are you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, and ’most dressed. Hustle, can’t you?
and let’s go out and chase around the place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Before breakfast?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; breakfast isn’t until eight o’clock, and
it’s only six now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, I’ll hustle,” and Dolly sprang out
of bed, and began to dress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The twins were a self-reliant pair, and quite
capable and methodical when they had time to
be.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly dressed herself neatly in a clean blue
and white plaid gingham; and as she could tie
her hair ribbon quite well enough, except for
special occasions, the blue bow on her golden
curls was entirely satisfactory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m all ready, Dick,” she whispered at last,
through the door, “and we mustn’t make any
noise, for maybe the aunties are asleep yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right; I’ll meet you in the hall.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So both children went on tiptoe out into the
big, light hall, and softly down the stairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No one seemed to be stirring, but they unfastened
the locks and chains of the front doors,
and stepped out into the beautiful fresh morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve <span class='it'>got</span> to holler!” said Dick, still whispering.
“They can’t hear us now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, they can; wait till we get farther away
from the house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So, hand in hand, they ran down the garden
path, and when a grape arbour and a cornfield
were between them and their sleeping aunts,
they decided they were out of hearing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hooray!” yelled Dick, as loud as he could,
at the same time turning a jubilant handspring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly was quite as glad as her brother, but
contented herself with dancing about, and giving
little squeals of delight as she saw one rapturous
sight after another.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Dick,” she cried, “there’s a fountain!
’way over there on the little hill. Do you s’pose
that’s on our grounds?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“’Course it is. This is all ours, as far as you
can see, and more too. That woodsy place over
there is ours; Pat told me so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll have picnics there. And Dick, maybe
there are fairies in the woods.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure there are. That’s just the kind of
woods that has fairies. But they only come out
at night, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, but it’s only just a little past night now.
The sun has only been up a short time. Maybe
there are some fairies there yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe; let’s go and see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a skip and a jump the children started
for the woods, which, however proved to be farther
away than they had thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They trudged merrily on, stopping now and
then to speak to a robin, or kick at a dandelion,
but at last they came to the edge of the grove.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Dick!” cried Dolly, in ecstasy, “think
of having a real woods, right in our own yard!
Isn’t it gorgeous!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Great! but go softly now, if we want to see
fairies. I’m ’fraid they’ve all gone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hand in hand the children tiptoed into the
wood. They moved very cautiously, lest they
should step on a twig, or make any noise that
should frighten the fairies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s where they dance,” whispered Dick,
pointing to a smooth, green mossy place. “But
of course they always fly away when the sun
rises.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I s’pose so,” said Dolly, regretfully.
“Shall we come out earlier to-morrow?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; or we might come out to see them
some night. Moonlight nights; that’s the
time!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would you dare? Oh, Dick, wouldn’t it be
grand!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hey, Dolly, there’s a squirrel; a real, live
one! That’s better’n fairies. Oh, look at
him!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sure enough, a grey squirrel ran past them,
and now sat, turning his head back to look at
them, but ready for instant flight if they moved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But they didn’t move, they knew better; and
scarce daring to breathe, they sat watching the
wonderful sight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meantime, there was consternation in the
household. At seven o’clock Miss Rachel had
sent Hannah, the waitress, to call the twins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The maid returned with a scared face, and
announced that the children had gone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gone!” cried Miss Rachel, who was engaged
in making her own toilet; “where have
they gone?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know, ma’am; but they’re not in
their rooms, and the front door is wide open.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, they’ve run away!” cried Miss Rachel,
and hastily throwing on a dressing gown, she
went to her sister’s room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get up, Abbie,” she exclaimed. “Those
children have run away!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Run away? What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, they’ve gone! I suppose they didn’t
like us. Perhaps they were homesick, or something.
Abbie, do you suppose they’ve gone back
to Chicago, all alone?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nonsense, Rachel, of course they haven’t!
Children always rise early. They’re probably
walking in the garden.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I don’t think so. Something tells me
they’ve run away because they don’t like us.
Oh, Abbie, do you think that’s it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I don’t. Go on and dress. They’ll be
back by the time you’re ready for breakfast. If
you’re worried, send Hannah out to hunt them
up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Hannah was sent, but as she only looked
in the verandas and in the gardens near the
house, of course, she didn’t find the twins. By
the time the ladies came downstairs, Hannah
had impressed Pat and Michael into service, and
all three were hunting for the missing guests.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it never occurred to them to go so far as
the woods, where Dick and Dolly were even
then sitting, watching the grey squirrel, and
looking for fairies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m thinkin’ they’ve fell in the pond,” said
Pat, as he gazed anxiously into the rather muddy
water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not thim!” said Michael; “they’re not
the sort that do be afther drownin’ thimsilves.
They’re too frisky. Belikes they’ve run back
to the brook where they shtopped at yisterday.
Do yez go there an’ look, Pat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, do,” said Miss Rachel, who, with
clasped hands and a white face was pacing the
veranda.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t take it so hard, sister,” implored Miss
Abbie. “They’re around somewhere, I’m sure;
and if not,—why, you know, Rachel, you didn’t
want them here very much, anyway.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How can you be so heartless!” cried Miss
Rachel, her eyes staring reproachfully at her
sister. “I do want them; they’re brother’s children,
and this is their rightful home. But I wish
they wanted to stay. I’m sure they ran away
because they didn’t like us. Do you think we
were too harsh with them yesterday?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps so. At any rate, they <span class='it'>have</span> run
away. I thought they were in the garden, but
if so, they would have been found by now.
Do you suppose they took an early train back
to New York?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Abbie, how <span class='it'>can</span> you say so! Those
two dear little mites alone in a great city! I
can’t think it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s better than thinking they are drowned
in the pond.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Either is awful; and yet of course some
such thing must have happened.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two ladies were on the verge of hysterics,
and the servants, who had all been hunting for
the children, were nonplussed. Pat had jumped
on a horse, and galloped off to the brook which
had so taken their fancy the day before, and
Michael stood, with his hands in his pockets,
wondering if he ought to drag the pond.
Delia, the cook, had left the waiting breakfast
and had come to join the anxious household.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m thinkin’ they’re not far off,” she said;
“why don’t ye blow a horn, now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s a good idea,” said Miss Abbie; “try
it, Michael.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Michael found an old dinner-horn that
had hung unused in the barn for many years, and
he blew resounding blasts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But unfortunately, the babes in the woods
were too far away to hear, and forgetful of all
else they watched two squirrels, who, reassured
by the children’s quiet, ran back and forth, and
almost came right up to Dick and Dolly’s
beckoning fingers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If only we had something to feed them,”
said Dick, vainly hunting his pockets for something
edible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If only we had something to feed ourselves,”
said Dolly; “I’m just about starved.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So’m I; let’s go back now, and come to see
the squirrels some other time, and bring them
some nuts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, let’s.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So back they started, but leisurely, for they
had no thought of how the time had slipped by.
They paused here and there to investigate many
things, and it was well on toward nine o’clock
when they came within hearing of Michael’s
horn, on which he was blowing a last, despairing
blast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hear the horn!” cried Dick. “Do you
s’pose that’s the way they call the family to
breakfast?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it isn’t breakfast time, yet,” said Dolly,
confidently. “I’m hungry enough, but it can’t
be eight o’clock, I know. And, besides, I want
time to tidy up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The clean frock had lost its freshness, and the
blue bow was sadly askew, for somehow, try as
she would, Dolly never could keep herself spick
and span.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They trudged along, through the barnyard
and the garden, and finally came to the kitchen
door, which stood invitingly open.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s go in this way,” said Dolly; “it’s
nearer, and I can skin up to my room and brush
my hair. I don’t want Auntie Rachel to think
I’m always messy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In at the back door they went, and as the
kitchen was deserted, they looked around in
some surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Might as well catch a bun,” said Dick, seeing
a panful of rolls in the warming oven.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hungry children each took a roll, and
then sped on up to their rooms, intent on tidying
themselves for breakfast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For goodness’ sake, Dolly!” exclaimed
Dick’s voice through the door, “it’s after nine
o’clock! Do you s’pose they’ve had breakfast,
and where is everybody?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“After nine o’clock!” said Dolly, opening the
door, to make sure she had heard aright.
“Well, if this isn’t the queerest house! Hurry
up, Dick, and brush your hair, and we’ll go down
and see what’s the matter. I know they haven’t
had breakfast, for the kitchen range was all full
of cereals and things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few moments later, two neat and well-brushed
children tripped gaily downstairs. They
went into the library, where their two aunts,
nearly in a state of collapse, were reposing in
armchairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-morning, aunties,” said the twins,
blithely. “Are we late?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Abbie gasped and closed her eyes, at the
astonishing sight, but Miss Rachel, who was of a
different nature, felt all her anxiety turn to
exasperation, and she said, sternly:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You naughty children! Where have you
been?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, we just got up early, and went to look
around the place,” volunteered Dolly, “and we
didn’t know it got late so soon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But where were you? We’ve searched the
place over.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We went to the woods,” said Dick. “You
see, Aunt Abbie, I felt as if I must screech a
little, and we thought if we stayed too near the
house, we might wake you up. It was awful
early then. I don’t see how nine o’clock came so
soon! Did we keep breakfast back? I’m sorry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why did you want to screech?” said Miss
Abbie, quickly. “Are you homesick?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no! I mean screech for joy. Just
shout, you know, for fun, and jump around,
and turn somersaults. I always do those things
when I’m glad. But as it turned out, we
couldn’t, very much, for we were watching for
fairies, and then for squirrels, so we had to be
quiet after all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And so you wanted to shout for joy, did
you?” asked Aunt Rachel, much mollified at the
compliments they paid so unconsciously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes’m! Everything is so beautiful, and
so—so sort of enchanted.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Enchanted?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; full of fairies, and sprites. The woods,
you know, and the pond, and the fountain,—oh,
Dana Dene is the finest place I ever saw!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dick’s enthusiasm was so unfeigned, and his
little face shone with such intense happiness, that
Miss Rachel hadn’t the heart to scold him after
all. So, resolving to tell the twins later of the
trouble they had caused, she went away to tell
Delia to send in breakfast, and to tell Michael to
go and find Patrick, for the twins had returned.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“You see,” explained Dolly, as they sat at
breakfast, “we went out of the house at half-past
seven, by the big, hall clock. And I thought
then we’d stay an hour, and get back in time to
fix up before we saw you. We’re not very good
at keeping clean.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So I see,” said Aunt Abbie, glancing at several
grass stains and a zigzag tear that disfigured
Dolly’s frock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes’m; so we ’most always try to get in to
meals ahead of time, and that ’lows us to spruce
up some.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We try to,” said Dick, honestly, “but we
don’t always do it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” returned Dolly, calmly; “’most never.
But isn’t it ’stonishing how fast the time goes
when you think there’s plenty?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is,” said Aunt Rachel, a little grimly.
“And now that you’re to live here, you’ll have
to mend your ways, about being late, for I won’t
have tardiness in my house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” said Dolly, cheerfully; “I’ll hunt
up my watch. It doesn’t go very well, except
when it lies on its face; but if I put it in my
pocket upside down, maybe it’ll go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It must be a valuable watch,” remarked
Aunt Abbie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes’m, it is. Auntie Helen gave it to me for
a good-by gift, but I looked at it so often, that
I thought it would be handier to wear it hanging
outside, like a locket, you know. Well, I did,
and then it banged into everything I met. And
the chain caught on everything, and the watch
got dented, and the crystal broke, and one hand
came off. But it was the long hand, so as long
as the hour hand goes all right, I can guess at the
time pretty good. If I’d just had it with me this
morning, we’d been all right. I’m real sorry we
were late.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aunt Rachel smiled, but it was rather a grim
smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t set much store by people who are
sorry,” she said; “what I like, are people who
don’t do wrong things the second time. If you
are never late to breakfast again, that will please
me more than being sorry for this morning’s
escapade.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll do both,” said Dolly, generously, and
indeed, the twins soon learned to be prompt at
meals, which is a habit easily acquired, if one
wishes to acquire it.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'>“N</span>ow, children,” said Aunt Rachel, as
they all went into the library, after
breakfast, “you may play around as
you choose, but I don’t want you to go off the
premises without permission. No more wading
in the brook, and coming home looking disreputable.
You may go to our wood, or anywhere
on the place, and stay as long as you like,
provided you are here and properly tidy at meal-times
But outside the gates, without permission,
you must not go: Can I trust you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, indeed, Aunt Rachel,” said Dick; “I’m
sure we don’t want to go anywhere else, with all
this beautiful place to play in. Why, we haven’t
half explored it yet. Pat says there are thirty
acres! Think of that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, it’s a fine old place,” said Miss Rachel,
with justifiable pride in her ancestral home.
“And I’m glad to have you young people in it,
if you’ll only behave yourselves, and not keep
us everlastingly in hot water.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We do want to be good, Auntie,” said
Dolly, in her sweet way; “and if we’re bad a
few times, just till we learn your ways, you
know, you’ll forgive us, won’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pretty little Dolly had a wheedlesome voice,
and a winning smile, and Miss Rachel found it
difficult to speak sternly, when the big, dark eyes
looked into her face so lovingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I’m sure you want to be good, my
dears, and also, we want to do the right thing
by you. So we’ll learn each other’s ways, and
I’m sure we’ll get along beautifully.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Rachel was not used to children, and she
talked to them as if they were as grown-up as
herself, but Dick and Dolly understood, and sat
patiently while she talked, though, in truth, they
were impatient to get away, and run outdoors
again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall send you to school,” went on Miss
Rachel, “but not for a week or two yet. I want
to learn you myself a little better first.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes’m,” said Dolly, who was equally well
pleased to go to school or to stay at home. But
Dick wanted to go.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us go pretty soon, won’t you, Auntie?”
he said; “for I want to get acquainted with the
Heatherton fellows.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Boys, Dick,” corrected Aunt Abbie, who
was beginning to think the twins rather careless
of their diction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes’m, I mean boys. Are there any who
live near here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Rachel pursed her lips together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Middletons live in the place next to
this,” she began, and Dolly broke in:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, that pretty place, with the stone pillars
at the gate?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” went on her aunt. “But Mrs. Middleton
and we are not—that is—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you’re not good friends, is that it?”
volunteered Dick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, yes; I suppose that is it. You children
are too young to understand, but let it be
enough for you that I prefer you should not
play with the little Middletons. There are
other neighbours equally pleasant for your acquaintance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, Auntie,” agreed Dick. “Cut
out the Middletons. And now mayn’t we run
out to play?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“First, I’ll take you up and show you your
playroom. It’s more for rainy days, as you
seem to like to be out of doors in fine weather.
But come and see it, anyway.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two aunts led the way, and the children
followed to a large, delightful room in the third
story.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a big table in the middle, and
smaller tables and chairs about. There was a
pleasant little writing-desk for each, well furnished
with pretty writing materials. Low
bookshelves ran round two sides of the room,
and the other side showed a jolly big fireplace,
and pleasant windows with deep seats.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A roomy, comfortable old sofa and a chest of
drawers completed the furnishing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It isn’t finished,” said Miss Abbie, “because
we don’t yet know your tastes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s lovely, Aunties!” cried Dolly, flinging
her arms round the neck of one after the
other, and finally embracing Dick in her enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it’s just gay!” Dick cried. “I’ve
always wanted a big playroom, and now
we’ve got one. Can I whittle and jigsaw up
here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, you may do just exactly as you please.
You may bring your young friends up here, and
entertain them whenever you choose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is, after we get the friends,” supplemented
Dolly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, but you’ll soon get acquainted. There
are many nice children in Heatherton. Do you
play dolls, Dolly?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I do, when I have any little girls to
play with. But, you see, I play with Dick so
much, I get out of the habit of dolls. But I do
love ’em. When our big box of things comes,
I’ve lots of dolls in it, and Dick’s tool-chest and
jigsaw—oh, it will be splendid to fix them all up
here!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Michael will help you. He’ll fix a
good workbench, for you, Dick, if you’re fond
of fussing with tools. Do you cut your fingers
much?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sometimes, Aunt Rachel, but not always.
Say, you’re awful good to us. We’re ever so
much obliged.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dick was more awkward at expressing his appreciation
than Dolly, but the honest joy on the
boy’s face showed his admiration of the room,
and Aunt Rachel’s heart warmed toward him,
for she too was sometimes unable to express
herself aptly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now we’ll skiddoo,” said Dolly, as she
patted Miss Abbie’s hand by way of farewell.
“We want to see Pat feed the chickens.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, dearie, run along, but,—would you
mind if I ask you not to use those—those unusual
words?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Skiddoo? Oh, that’s an awful useful word,
Aunt Abbie. I don’t see how I could get along
without it, but I’ll try if you say so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, do try, Dolly; I want my niece to be
a refined, ladylike little girl, not a slangy one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes’m.” Dolly drew a little sigh. “I want
to do what you want me to do. But I’m pretty
forgetful, Aunt Abbie, so don’t be ’scouraged,
will you, if I don’t get good all at once?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly had a childish trick of omitting the first
syllable of a word, but Aunt Abbie kissed the
earnest little face, and assured her that she
wouldn’t get ’scouraged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So away the twins scampered, down the stairs,
and out into the sweet, clear morning air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dana Dene stood high on an elevation that
looked down on the small town of Heatherton.
The view from the terrace in front of the house
was beautiful, and as Dick and Dolly looked
down at the clustered buildings they tried to
guess what they were.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s the church,” said Dick, triumphantly
pointing to an unmistakable spire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One of ’em,” corrected Dolly; “there’s
another, and I wonder what that big stone
building is; prob’ly the school where we’ll
go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“P’raps. Is it, Patrick?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, no, Master Dick; that isn’t exactly
the school fer ye children. That’s the jail,—the
county jail, so it is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” cried Dolly, in dismay; “I don’t want
to go to school to a jail! Where is the school-house,
Patrick?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s three of ’em, Miss Dolly. But the
grandest is that white house ferninst, an’ I’m
thinkin’ ye’ll go there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are my aunts very grand, Patrick?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, miss. We’re the quality of the
hull place. There’s nobody like the Danas.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s nice,” said Dolly, with a little air
of satisfaction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Huh,” said Dick; “what sort of a country
do you think this is, Dolly? Everybody is as
good as everybody else. Why do you talk that
way, Pat?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, sor, it may be. But everybody in
Heatherton, they thinks Miss Rachel and Miss
Abbie is top o’ the heap, you see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” returned Dick. “I don’t mind
if we are. But what about the Middletons?
Aren’t they nice people?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pat’s face clouded. “Don’t be askin’ me
about the Middletons,” he said; “I’ve nothin’
to say for or agin ’em. Now, if so be’s you want
to see them chickens, come ahead.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They went ahead or, rather, they followed
Pat to the chicken yard, and spent a blissful
half-hour among the feathered wonders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They learned the names of the various kinds
of chickens, and Dolly declared she should
never tire of watching the little yellow fledglings
patter around and peep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re not still a minute,” she said. “Can
I try to catch one?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pat showed her how to lift one gently, without
hurting the little soft ball of down, and as
it was such a pretty little yellow one, Dolly
named it Buttercup, and Pat said it should always
be her own chicken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Dick picked one out for his very own,
and he chose a black one, and called it Cherry,
because, he said, some cherries are black.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This made Pat laugh, and then he told the
twins to run away and play by themselves, as he
had to go to work in earnest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s your work, Pat?” asked Dolly,
who liked to stay with the good-natured Irishman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have to do the gardens, Miss Dolly. An’
it’s rale work, it is, not play. So do ye run away,
now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Pat, let us see you garden,” begged
Dolly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please do,” said Dick. “We never saw
anybody garden in our life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ye didn’t! Fer the love of green corn,
where was ye brung up?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the city; and summers we had to go
to hotels, and we never even saw a garden
dug.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on, then; but ye mustn’t bother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, we won’t bother,” and with a hop,
skip, and jump, they followed Pat to the toolhouse.
There was such an array of spades, hoes,
rakes, and other implements, that Dick cried
out: “Oh, let us garden, too! Pat, can’t we
each have a little garden,—just a square patch,
you know, and plant things in it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Arrah, a garden, is it? An’ who’d be afther
weedin’ it, an’ keepin’ it in order fer ye?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, we’d do it ourselves,” declared Dolly,
fixing her eyes on Pat with her most coaxing
smile. “Do let us, Pat, dear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, ye must ask yer aunties. I cudden’t
give no such permission of myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Away flew the twins to the house, in search of
the aunties, and when the twins ran, it was a
swift performance indeed. They held hands,
and their feet flew up and down so fast that
they looked like some queer sort of windmill
rolling along.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bang! in at the front door they went, and
almost upset Miss Rachel, who was serenely
crossing the hall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Auntie, may we have a garden?”
shouted Dick, seizing his aunt’s hand, and leaning
up against her to steady himself after his
exhausting run.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Auntie, may we? Do say yes,” cried
Dolly, who had flung her arms round Miss
Rachel’s waist, and who was dancing up and
down to the imminent danger of the good lady’s
toes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What? Oh, my, how you do fluster me!
What is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Rachel shook off the two, and seated
herself in a hall chair, to regain her equilibrium,
both physical and mental, but the twins made
another wild dash at her. “Please,” they
coaxed, patting her arm and her face and occasionally
each other’s hands in their excitement.
“Please, Auntie, a garden for our very
own.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Two,—one for each of us. May we? Oh,
please say yes! Do, Auntie, do, say yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Rachel found her voice at last.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you want anything,” she said, “stop
jumping around like a pair of wild savages.
Sit down on that settee, and tell me quietly, and
one at a time, what it’s all about.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me tell, Dick,” said Dolly, and knowing
his sister’s talent for persuasion, Dick willingly
kept quiet while Dolly told.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They sat side by side on the hall settee, opposite
their aunt, and scarcely dared move, while
Dolly made her plea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see, Auntie,” she began, “we’ve never
had a garden; never even seen one made. And
so, we thought, perhaps, maybe, as there’s so
much spare ground lying around, we hoped
maybe you’d let us each have a little garden of
our own. Just a little tiny one, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For pity’s sake,” exclaimed Miss Rachel,
“is all this fuss about a garden? Why, you
can have a dozen, if you like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, thank you, Auntie,” cried Dolly, repressing
her inclination to fly over and hug her
aunt, lest it be considered a “fuss.” “One’s
enough,—one apiece, I mean. And what can
we plant?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, plant anything you choose. Pat will
give you seeds, and if he hasn’t what you want,
we’ll buy some when we go driving this afternoon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dick was overcome by his aunt’s kindness and
whole-souled generosity. But he had no intention
of making a fuss,—not he. He rose and
quietly crossed the hall, and bowing low in front
of the lady, said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aunt Rachel, I do think you’re the very best
person in the whole world!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So do I!” said Dolly. “Seems ’s if I <span class='it'>must</span>
squeeze you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not now,” said Miss Rachel, smiling; “you
nearly squeezed the breath out of me a few moments
ago. I’ll take your enthusiasm for
granted. Now, run out, and make your gardens.
Tell Pat I said you’re to have whatever
you want for them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hurray! Hooroo!” cried Dick, unable to
repress himself longer, and throwing his cap up
in the air, without having had the least intention
of doing so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It landed on the high chandelier, and Hannah
had to bring the long-handled feather duster
to get it down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please ’scuse Dick, Aunt Rachel,” said loyal
little Dolly, seeing her brother’s regretful look.
“He didn’t mean to fling that cap till he got
outdoors, but somehow——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Somehow, it flung itself,” cried Dick;
“’cause I’m so glad about the garden!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Away they went, banging the door behind
them, and Miss Rachel sat a few minutes, seriously
considering whether or not she could keep
such little cyclones in her hitherto quiet and well-ordered
home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It isn’t so much what they’ve done,” she said,
as she went and talked it over with Miss Abbie,
“as what they may do. They’re liable to fling
caps anywhere, and break all the bric-à-brac, and
bang all the furniture—well, if there were any
place to send them, they should go to-day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t mean that, Rachel,” said Miss
Abbie. “They are noisy, I know, but I think
we can train them to better manners; and they
have dear, loving little hearts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Too loving,” said the elder sister, ruefully.
“They nearly felled me to the floor, the way
they rushed at me. I’m not over the shock
yet!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” sighed Miss Abbie, “I suppose it’s
because we’re not used to children; but they do
seem especially sudden in their ways.”</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;font-size:1em;'>A PLAYGROUND</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'>“S</span>udden in their ways,” just described
Dick and Dolly. After getting their
aunt’s sanction, they flew back to the
toolhouse, and tumbling in at the door, nearly
upset Pat by their sudden dash for spades and
hoes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She says we can!” cried Dolly; “how do
you begin, Pat? What do we do first?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dig, of course,” declared Dick, seizing the
biggest spade he could find.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right; where shall we dig?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly grabbed another spade, and skipping
out of the toolhouse, began to dig frantically in
the path that led from the doorstep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whisht! now! Miss Dolly, don’t be fer
sp’ilin’ me good path!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pat was amiable, but the vigorous enthusiasm
of these children began to appal him. He was
always deferential to his employers, and he
looked upon the twins as members of his employers’
family, and so he considered himself
under their orders. But he also began to see
that he must direct matters himself, if these
impetuous youngsters were to have a real garden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” he said, “if so be’s yer aunts has
give permission, we must make the gardens fer
ye. But we must do ’t dacint an’ proper. Don’t
begin by diggin’ up me tidy paths.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I won’t, Pat; I’m sorry!” and Dolly carefully
smoothed away the clefts she had dug with
her spade.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, we’ll consider,” said Pat, greatly interested
in the plan. “First of all, where will
ye be selectin’ the place?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The twins gazed around, at the various gardens,
terrace, woodland, and water, and then
Dolly said, decidedly:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the woods; that’s the prettiest place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, ho!” laughed Pat. “Why, little miss,
ye can’t grow things in the woods! Leastwise,
only ferns an’ moss! Don’t ye want flowers,
now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes; of course we do! And I forgot
they have to have sunshine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Goosie!” cried Dick. “Now, I think a
place near the pond would be nice, and then we
can fetch water easily,—for I s’pose we have to
water our flowers every day, don’t we, Pat?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; onless it rains fer ye, which it sometimes
do. Now, s’pose ye let me s’lect yer place,
an’ then do ye pick out yer own choice o’
flowers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do,” cried Dolly. “You know so much
better than we do where a garden ought to be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pat considered carefully for a few moments,
casting his eye thoughtfully toward various
parts of the estate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on,” he said, at last, and the children
followed him, as he strode off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just beyond the beautifully kept terrace was
a stretch of lawn, entirely open to the sunlight,
save for a big horse-chestnut tree in one corner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here Pat paused, and indicating by a sweep
of his arm a section about seventy-five feet
square, he said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m thinkin’, instead of only a garden, by
itself, it’d be foine for ye to make yersilves a
rale playground.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly’s quick mind jumped to the possibilities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Pat, a playground, all for ourselves,
with our two gardens in it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, miss; and an arbour, and seats, an’ a
table, an’——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he got no further, for Dick and Dolly
seized him by either hand, and jumped up and
down, fairly shouting with delight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Pat, Pat, I never heard of anything
so lovely!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How could you think of it? Let’s begin
at once!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But ye must behave!” cried Pat, shaking
his hands loose from their grasp, and waiting
for them to stop their antics.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, yes; we’ll behave!” said Dolly, suddenly
standing stock-still, and looking very;
demure. “What do we do first, dig?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m thinkin’ yez better dig a whole acre,—an’
see if ye can’t work off some of yer animile
sperrits! Such rampageous bein’s I niver
saw!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll be quiet, Pat,” said Dick, earnestly;
“now let’s begin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, thin,—first, we must plan it, sure.
Suppose we drive a shtake here fer wan corner;
and thin the big tree will be the opposite corner.
Now ye see the size av it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” agreed Dolly, “it’s a lovely size.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thin, supposin’ we plan to set out a little
low hedge all around the four sides, wid an
openin’ or two——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And an arched gateway!” cried Dolly, with
sparkling eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, miss, say an arched gateway or
two. An’ then, inside ye can have three
or four garden-beds,—fer sep’rate plants, ye
know,—an’ yer arbour, an’ whativer else ye
like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!” said Dolly, sitting plump down on
the ground from sheer inability to bear up under
these wonderful anticipations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, what’s to do first?” said Dick, eager
to get to work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, first we’ll lay out our flower beds.
Now I don’t s’pose ye know the difference between
seeds an’ plants, do ye?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes! Plants grow from seeds.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, av coorse they do. But I don’t mean
that. Ye see, some flowers ye set out as plants;
an’ some ye raise from seeds.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I think seeds will be most fun,” said
Dolly: “You just stuff ’em in the ground and
then they grow, don’t they, Pat?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, yes, miss; if yer seeds is right, an’
yer ground’s right, an’ if ye stuff ’em in right,
an’ take care of ’em right, afterward.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, we can do all that,” Dick assured him,
grandly, and Pat’s eyes twinkled, as he replied:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Av coorse ye can!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Pat called Michael to help him, and
they drove stakes and tied twine to them, until
they had the playground distinctly marked out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, we’ll consider yer flower-beds, an’
lave the other considerations till later,” announced
Pat. “Ye see, yer seed-beds must be
in the mornin’ sun, an’ have the shade of an
afthernoon. So, wid the big tree ferninst, we
can aisy manage that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Seeds seem to be pretty particular,” observed
Dolly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They be that, Miss; but so likewise is the
plants. Some wants sun an’ some wants shade,
an’ if they don’t get what they wants, they jist
lies down an’ dies!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Pat and Michael selected the best spots,
and marked out two oval flower-beds of goodly
size, and two straight, narrow seed-beds somewhat
smaller.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Dolly’s, we’ll say, will be on this side,
an’ Master Dick’s on that. Now, if so be’s ye
childhern wants to dig, fer mercy’s sake dig!
Ye can’t hurt the ground.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pat well knew that his own strong arms would
spade up the beds later, and he would fill them
with the right sort of soil, and get them in perfect
order for planting; but the twins were delighted
at the idea of doing their own digging,
and went to work with their usual enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was hard work, but they enjoyed it, and
though not very scientifically done, they did
manage to dislodge the soft turf, and riddle up
the dirt beneath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I s’pose it won’t be such hard work after
the digging is dug,” said Dolly, looking at her
blistered little palms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Dolly Dana!” exclaimed Aunt Abbie,
who came out just then, to see how the
gardens progressed; “don’t you dig another
bit! You poor, dear child, your hands are in a
dreadful state! Go in and ask Aunt Rachel for
some salve.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, indeedy!” declared the valiant Dolly.
“I’m going to plant my seeds now!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no, miss,” said Pat. “Them beds isn’t
ready yet. Nor ye haven’t got yer seeds.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t be too impetuous, Dolly,” said Aunt
Abbie. “This afternoon, we’ll plan out what
is best to plant and then by to-morrow, if Patrick
has the beds ready, you can do your planting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dick was still digging away, manfully, quite
unwilling to admit there were blisters on his own
hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Aunt Abbie made him stop, for though
the digging was good fun, there was no use in
causing himself needless pain, and Patrick
would do the beds all over, anyway. So Aunt
Abbie persuaded the children to turn their
attention to planning their playground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She quite approved of Pat’s suggestions, and
sent for Miss Rachel to come out and assist with
the plans.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Both ladies were very fond of gardening, and
entered enthusiastically into the idea of the
pretty playground. Miss Rachel instructed Pat
to buy and set out a low hedge of privet all
round the inclosure; and they decided on two
entrances, front and back, each to be adorned
by an arch covered with a flowering vine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An arbour was planned for the centre, but
Dolly chose to call it a playhouse. For it was to
be big enough to have seats and a table inside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was to be built tent-shape; that is, very
long, slender poles would be set up in pairs,
meeting at the top, like the letter A. There
would be about a dozen pairs of these poles,
each pair about two feet apart, and thus they
would have a long arbour on which to train
vines and flowers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A ridge-pole along the top would keep it all
firm and steady, and quickly growing vines
should be chosen, which would soon cover the
whole frame.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Michael, who was clever at carpenter work,
volunteered to make a table and benches, and
Dick, who was also fond of tools, felt sure he
could help.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aunt Abbie said she would give a garden
swing as her contribution to the playground,
and Aunt Rachel said she, too, would give something
nice, but what it would be, was a secret as
yet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then it was nearly dinner-time, so they went
back to the house, and the four sorry-looking
little hands were carefully washed and anointed
with a soothing lotion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Heatherton people approved of midday dinners,
and so the hungry children sat down to an
ample and satisfying meal, to which they were
fully prepared to do justice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know,” said Aunt Rachel, as they
chatted at table, “you are to take care of these
gardens yourselves. Pat and Michael have all
they can do, already; and though they have helpers
in the busy seasons, I expect you two to weed
and water your own flower-beds.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course, Auntie,” said Dolly; “that’s
what we want to do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Else they wouldn’t be ours,” chimed in
Dick. “There are lots of flower-beds around
the place, but these are to be our very own.
And how can they be, if we don’t do all the
work on ’em?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s right,” said Aunt Rachel, approvingly.
“Patrick will superintend your work,
and he or Michael will keep the grass and the
paths in order, but the rest is for you to do. Do
you know anything about flowers?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not a thing!” declared Dolly. “But I
want to raise violets and carnation pinks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That proves you don’t know much,” said
Aunt Abbie, laughing. “Why, those are the
very things you couldn’t possibly raise!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why?” said Dolly, looking surprised.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because they are too difficult. They require
hothouses, or, at least cold frames. You
must content yourself with simpler blossoms;
nasturtiums, phlox, asters, peonies——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, those are just as good,” said Dolly.
“I don’t care much what flowers they are, if
they’ll grow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I like big plants,” said Dick. “Could
I have sunflowers and hollyhocks, Aunt
Rachel?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, my boy; I’m sure you can manage
those. Have a hedge at the back of your playground
of those flowers, and also cosmos and
goldenglow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After dinner they went to the library, and
made lists of the flowers they would have.
Aunt Abbie drew diagrams of their gardens,
and advised the right kinds of flowers to grow
together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want you to grow up to love gardening,”
said Miss Rachel, “but as you are now quite
young, and very ignorant on the subject, you
must begin with the simplest and easiest sorts
of plants.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the aunts explained how the children
must plant seeds in their seed-beds, and after
the tiny shoots sprang up, how they must be
separated and thinned out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And throw away some of them!” exclaimed
Dolly in dismay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; that’s to make the others stronger and
healthier plants.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do we plant in our big gardens?”
asked Dick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, there you can have such plants as
you want. Roses, geraniums, and Canterbury
Bells are good ones. And then, you transplant
to those beds your seedlings that you have
already started yourselves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And can’t we plant any seeds in the flower
beds?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes; such as do not need transplanting.
You can have borders of portulacca, candytuft,
sweet alyssum, and such things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My! it sounds grand!” said Dolly, to whom
nearly all these names were new.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now suppose we go out there again,” said
Aunt Rachel, “and see what seeds Pat has on
hand. Then we’ll know what to buy for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So back went the quartette, and found the
playground had assumed quite a definite air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A narrow strip of upturned earth showed the
line of the hedge that was to be set out. The
flower-beds and seed-beds were neatly cut in
shape and properly spaded. Little stakes
marked the places for the arbor poles, and
white cords outlined paths that were yet to be
cut.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It doesn’t seem possible it’s ours!” said
Dolly, drawing a blissful sigh of contentment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now here’s some seeds as I already have,”
said Pat, offering a box of packets to the
children.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, can we plant some now,—right away?”
asked Dick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; let us do so,” said Aunt Abbie, who
was nearly as eager as the children to get the
garden started.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So they selected nasturtiums, poppies, marigolds,
and morning glories from Pat’s box, and
all went to work at the planting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The aunts showed Dick and Dolly how to
poke a little hole in the ground, about three
inches deep, and then drop in a nasturtium seed.
Then they covered it over with dirt, pressed
it down lightly, and watered it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was an enthralling occupation, and the
children worked carefully and did just as they
were told. Poppies came next, and these seeds
were planted quite differently. The ground was
made quite smooth, and then slightly watered.
Then Pat showed them how to sprinkle the
fine seed scantily over the top of the ground,
and not put any dirt over it at all. A thin
layer of cut grass was scattered over them to
keep the seeds from too much sunlight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you know that some seeds must be
planted one way and some another?” asked
Dick, looking at Patrick with a new interest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s me business, Masther Dick. We all
has to know our business av coorse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The morning-glory seeds could not be planted
just then, as they had to soak in water for two
hours, so next they set out some pansy plants.
These Pat had expected to use elsewhere, but
at Miss Rachel’s direction, he handed them
over to the twins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was a new sort of work, and even more
fascinating than seed-planting. The tiny plants
were fragile and had to be handled very carefully.
Then a hole must be dug with a trowel,
the plant set in, and the soil gently filled in
about it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The twins each had a half-dozen pansy plants,
and Dick set his in a group, but Dolly arranged
hers in a border. Then Miss Rachel said they
had done enough for one day, and she marched
them off to the house to get rested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But did Dick and Dolly rest? Not they!
They didn’t seem to know what the word meant.
They went up to their playroom, and sitting
together at the table, they drew diagrams and
plans for their playground until the aunties
called them downstairs again.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='72' id='Page_72'></span><h1>CHAPTER VI</h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;font-size:1em;'>A SOCIAL CALL</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'>T</span>he twins gladly obeyed their aunts’
summons, for it meant to get ready to
go to town to buy their flower seeds.
Long before the ladies were ready, Dick and
Dolly, in trim attire, and with pretty spring
coats and hats, sat in the library waiting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I like this home a lot, don’t you, Dollums?”
said Dick, as he thoughtfully looked about him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Love it!” responded his twin promptly.
“Chicago was nice, too, and Auntie Helen was
gay and pretty, but this is so country and all.
And oh, Dick, won’t our playground be splendiferous!
Do you s’pose the arbor will <span class='it'>ever</span>
get built and grown over with flowers and
things?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“’Course it will! And, Dolly, I’m going to
make some rustic seats and things myself. It
tells how in my ‘Handy Book,’ and I’m sure I
can do it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sure you can too. And can’t you make
some little seats for my dolls?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dick had just agreed to do this when the two
aunties came downstairs, and they all went out
to the carriage. Somehow it seemed very formal.
Aunt Rachel and Aunt Abbie, all dressed up
in calling costume, with gloves and parasols,
didn’t seem so chummy as when they were all
out planting seeds together. And Michael, in
his coachman’s livery, looked so straight and
unintelligent that it was hard to believe he was
the same man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They all got into the big, open carriage, and
the twins sat backward, facing their aunts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“First,” said Miss Rachel, who sat up very
stiff and prim, “we will go and buy the seeds
and plants, and then we will pay some calls.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This seemed very strange to Dick and Dolly,
for they had never been taken calling with
Auntie Helen in Chicago; but they made no
comment, as none seemed to be expected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The carriage stopped at a small shop, and the
proprietor hurried out to greet the ladies. He
bowed with great deference, and asked what
he might show them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Rachel had a list of the seeds and plants
they had decided on for the children’s gardens,
and the shopman said he would send them all
the next day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And have you some small garden implements?”
asked Miss Abbie. “Some little
rakes and hoes, suitable for children’s use.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The shopman said he would bring some out
to show them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Auntie,” cried Dolly, impulsively,
“can’t we go in the shop and look at them?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, indeed,” said Miss Rachel, as if Dolly
had asked something highly improper. “Stay
where you are and make your selections.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly wondered why they couldn’t hop out,
but it didn’t much matter, as the man returned,
followed by a youth who brought a lot of
spades and rakes and garden tools of many sorts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The children were allowed to select all they
wanted, and, guided by Aunt Rachel’s advice,
they chose quite a great many.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re awful good to us,” exclaimed Dick
as, after giving the order, they drove away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you must be good to us,” said Aunt
Rachel, smiling. “Now we are going to call
at Mrs. Fuller’s. She has a son Jack, about ten
years old, and I hope you will be good friends
with him. There are no little girls here, but,
Dolly, we will find some girl friends for you
later on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I like boys,” said Dolly, agreeably. “I
like Dick better than any girl, so, of course, I
like other boys too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At Mrs. Fuller’s they were ushered into a stiff,
formal-looking parlour, which had the effect of
being rarely used. The half-drawn blinds gave
but a dim light, and the four guests took their
seats in silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dick and Dolly felt depressed without knowing
just why. They secretly wished they could
clasp hands and make a dash for the door and
run away, but Aunt Rachel had asked them to
be good, so they sat still, wondering what would
be expected of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After what seemed a long time, Mrs. Fuller
came into the room. She was a lady of very
precise manners, and wore a rustling silk gown.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ladies all shook hands quite stiffly, and inquired
for each other’s health, and then Miss
Rachel presented the twins to Mrs. Fuller.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you do, my dears?” said the lady,
offering her finger-tips to each in turn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m very well, thank you; how are you?”
said Dolly, heartily, as she cordially gave her
hostess’s hand a vigorous shake. But the chagrin
on the Dana ladies’ faces, and the surprised
glance of Mrs. Fuller, proved at once that this
wasn’t the right thing to do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Quick to catch the hint, Dick offered his hand
hesitatingly,—so much so indeed, that it lay
in Mrs. Fuller’s like a little limp fish, and as she
finally dropped it, it fell loosely to Dick’s side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How d’ do?” he murmured, uncertain what
to say, and then, feeling very uncomfortable,
the two children sat down again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a time no attention was paid to them, and
the ladies conversed in short, elegant sentences,
and high-pitched voices.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Mrs. Fuller turned again to the twins:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you like Heatherton?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The suddenness of the question took Dick unawares,
and he said enthusiastically:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Out o’ sight!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Immediately he realised that he should have
expressed himself more formally, and the look
of annoyance on Aunt Rachel’s face made him
red and embarrassed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Loyal little Dolly tried, as always, to come to
his rescue, and she said politely:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, indeed, Mrs. Fuller; we like it awfully
well so far, but of course we haven’t been here
very long yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you think you won’t like it when you’ve
been here longer! Is that it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Fuller meant only to be jocose, but
Dolly didn’t understand, and tried hard to explain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No ’m; I don’t mean that. I mean I think
we’ll like it better after we live here a while.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I trust you will,” said Mrs. Fuller. “You
must be hard to please if you don’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Poor Dolly felt herself misunderstood, but she
could think of nothing to say, so she sat silent,
but, it seemed, this was not the right thing to
do either.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Speak up, child,” said Aunt Rachel, half
playfully and half sharply; “didn’t you hear
Mrs. Fuller’s remark?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes ’m,” said Dolly, “but,—but I don’t
know what to answer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Strange child,” murmured Mrs. Fuller. “Is
the boy any more civil?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dick, though embarrassed himself, was still
more annoyed at Dolly’s discomfiture, and spoke
up decidedly:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We don’t mean to be uncivil, Mrs. Fuller.
But we’ve never made fashionable calls before,
and we don’t know quite how to talk. It’s so
different in Chicago.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Different in Chicago! I should hope so.
My dear Miss Dana and Miss Abbie, you’ll
have your hands full with these little ones,
won’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At first,” said Miss Rachel with dignity.
“But we hope to teach them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And we want to learn,” put in Dolly, with an
instinctive desire to stand by her aunt against
this disagreeable lady.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then there’ll be no trouble, I’m sure,” said
Mrs. Fuller, but though her words were all
right, her tone was a little bit sarcastic, and the
twins were conscious of a feeling of defeat,
which was far from comfortable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Jack Fuller came into the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was a boy of ten, with fair hair, and a pale,
girlish face. He, apparently, had irreproachable
manners, and gave his hand to the Dana
ladies with just the right degree of cordiality.
Then, being introduced to Dick and Dolly, he
came and sat on the sofa between them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Instinctively, Dick felt that he never could like
that boy. Jack had scarcely opened his mouth
before Dick had dubbed him a “Miss Nancy.”
He didn’t believe Jack could run or jump, or
do anything that a boy ought to do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you like to live here?” said Jack at last,
by way of opening conversation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, we do,” said Dolly; “we’re going to
have splendid gardens,—we’ve been digging all
day. Don’t you love to do that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jack looked at her with apparent surprise
that a girl should care for such vigorous
pursuits.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never dig,” he answered. “Mamma
thinks it isn’t good for me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How funny!” said Dolly. “I should think
it would do you good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you like to run and jump?” asked Dick,
for there had been a pause, and he <a id='con'></a>considered
it his turn to “make talk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, not very much. I like quiet games. I
play mostly by myself. Mamma won’t let me
associate with many children. But I’m to be
allowed to play with you. I know that, because
you’re Danas.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was gratifying in a way, but somehow
Dick wasn’t over-enchanted at the prospect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope you will,” he said; “but I’m afraid,—when
we’re playing, we’re rather,—rather
rampageous.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rough, do you mean?” asked Jack, looking
horrified.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, we don’t mean to be rough exactly;
but we’re sort of noisy and lively.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I shall visit you all the same,” said
Jack, with a resigned air, “for mamma said I
should. I think I’m to go see you to-morrow
afternoon at four.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This specified date amused the Dana children,
but Dolly said politely:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That will be very nice, and I’m sure we’ll
have a good time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then the aunties rose to take leave, and
they all went home again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You children must learn better manners,”
said Aunt Rachel, as they drove homeward.
“You horrified me to-day by your manner of
speaking.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I saw we did,” said Dolly, humbly, “but I
don’t see what we did that was wrong. I’m sure
we didn’t mean to be bad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You weren’t bad,” said Abbie, smiling at
them, “but we want you to acquire a little more
grace and elegance. You spoke, in Mrs. Fuller’s
parlour, just as you would at home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” said Dick, “I begin to see; you want
us to put on society airs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aunt Rachel considered a moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“While I shouldn’t express it in just that
way,” she said, “that is about what I
mean.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said Dick pleasantly, “we’ll try.
But Aunty Helen always taught us to be just
as polite when alone at home as when we were
visiting or had company.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Auntie Helen isn’t teaching you now,” said
Miss Rachel, grimly; “and I trust you’ll consider
my wishes in the matter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We will, Aunt Rachel, we truly will,” broke
in Dolly, whose rôle was often that of pacificator.
“You’re terribly good to us, and we want to do
’zackly as you want us to, but, you see, fashionable
calls are new to us. We’ll do better
next time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly’s cheerful smile was infectious, and
Aunt Rachel smiled back, and dropped the subject
of manners for the present.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next afternoon, promptly at four o’clock,
Jack Fuller came to see Dick and Dolly. The
twins had been grubbing in their gardens all
day, and had been radiantly happy.</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='gard'></a>They loved flowers and learned quickly the elements
of gardening that Pat taught them. And
with their new garden tools of suitable size, they
did real work after the most approved fashion.
But at three o’clock they were called in to get
ready for the expected guest. Dick grumbled a
little, for it seemed hard to leave the gardens
to get all dressed up just because a <span class='it'>boy</span> was
coming!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you want to make friends in Heatherton,
don’t you?” asked Aunt Rachel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes ’m; but I like boys who come over and
play in every-day clothes; not rig up like a
party.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As for Dolly, she didn’t see why she had to
leave the garden at all. Jack Fuller wasn’t her
company.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the aunts decreed that both twins should
receive the guest properly, and so at quarter to
four, two spick and span, but not very merry
children sat in the library, waiting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jack came in, at last, and greeted the twins
with the same formality he had shown in his own
home. He responded politely to the elder
ladies’ remarks and Dick and Dolly tried to be
polite and do exactly as the others did.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After nearly half an hour of this stiff and uncomfortable
conversation, Miss Rachel proposed
that the twins take Jack out and show him their
gardens. Glad to get out of doors, Dick and
Dolly ran for their hats and the three children
started out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To the twins’ astonishment, as soon as he was
out of the presence of the elder ladies, Jack
turned into quite a different boy. His formal
manner fell away, and he was chummy and full
of fun.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s throw stones,” he cried. “See me hit
that stone bird on the fountain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He flung a pebble with such true aim that it
hit the stone bird on the wing, and roused Dick’s
exceeding admiration, for he was not himself a
superior marksman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Want to play knife?” asked Jack, pulling a
new knife from his pocket; “or no, let’s go see
your gardens first. Must be gay ones, from
the fuss you make over ’em.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But when he saw the playground that was
planned, he was appreciative enough to satisfy
the twins’ love of enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s great!” he cried; “that’s what it is,
great! I wish I had one like it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, won’t it be fine!” agreed Dick;
“there’ll be a table in the arbour, and chairs, or
benches, and we can have tea-parties, and everything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Plant gourds on your arbour,” advised Jack.
“All kinds are good, but the dipper and cucumber
gourd grow the fastest. They’ll cover your
arbour in a few weeks, I guess. Hercules club is
a good fellow for that, too. Pat’ll know about
’em.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dick and Dolly felt their admiration rising for
this boy, who knew so much about climbing
gourds and flowers of all sorts. It was strange
that he could throw stones so straight, and
also have such fine parlour manners. So very
strange indeed that Dick felt he must inquire
into it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say,” he began; “you’re awful different out
here from what you are in the parlour.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure,” returned Jack. “In parlours, with
ladies, a fellow has to be polite and proper.
You don’t want me to be like that out here with
you, do you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jack’s face expressed such a willingness to do
what was required of him that Dick exclaimed
hastily:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not on your life! But I don’t see how you
manage those fine airs when you have to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pooh, it’s dead easy. Anyway, I’ve always
done it. Mamma wouldn’t like it if I didn’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I s’pose we’ll have to learn,” said Dolly,
sighing a little; “but don’t let’s bother about it
now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the afternoon wore on, and they became
better acquainted, they both began to like Jack
very much. He was not a strong boy, and
couldn’t run or jump as they could, but he was
clever at games, and could beat them easily at
“knife,” or “hop-scotch,” or almost any game
of muscular skill that did not call for violent
exercise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s all right,” said Dick to Dolly as they
sat on the veranda steps a few minutes after
Jack went home. “But I hope we won’t always
have to dress up, and sit in the parlour at first
every time he comes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s ask Aunt Rachel,” said Dolly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, no,” said Miss Rachel in surprise.
“Of course you won’t. To-day was his first visit,
as you called on him yesterday. After this, you
can go to play with each other in your every-day
clothes, whenever you like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dick and Dolly were satisfied with this, and
gave up trying to fathom the strange requirements
of etiquette at Heatherton.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='87' id='Page_87'></span><h1>CHAPTER VII</h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;font-size:1em;'>PINKIE</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'>T</span>he days passed happily at Dana Dene.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was so much to do, with the
gardens and the chickens, and going for
afternoon drives that, except on rainy days, the
children were out of doors nearly all the
time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Their big boxes had arrived, and Dolly’s dolls,
and Dick’s more boyish treasures, were up in
the playroom, but were often neglected for open-air
fun.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It had been decided by the aunties that the
twins should not go to school until Fall, for the
term was within a few weeks of closing, and it
didn’t seem worth while to start. But they were
required to practise on the piano an hour each
day, and a teacher came once a week to give them
lessons. The Misses Dana were fond of music,
and as they thought the twins showed some talent,
they insisted on its cultivation, though Dick
and Dolly looked upon their practice hour as
drudgery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They always practised at the same time, if
possible, in order to have their play hours together.
If they had been practising duets, this
plan might have been fairly agreeable to the
other members of the household. But the nine-year-old
twins had not yet arrived at the dignity
of “pieces,” and were confined to scales and
five-finger exercises.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Their scales usually started on harmonious
notes, but Dolly’s little fingers flew along the
keyboard so much faster than Dick’s that she
usually finished her scale on the highest notes,
and drummed away there until his chubby hands
came up and caught her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This, though a satisfactory plan to the performers,
was far from pleasant to the sensitive
ears of the Dana aunties.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again, in case of five-finger exercises, they
divided the piano fairly, and then diligently pursued
their “one-and, two-and, three-and” quite
irrespective of each other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they were careful not to infringe on one
another’s territory, they saw no objection to this
arrangement, and quite in despair, the aunts
would close the doors of the drawing-room,
where the musicians were, and retire to the
farthest corners of the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was, of course, great temptation for the
twins to neglect their task, and chatter, but they
were too conscientious for this.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Neither would have considered it honourable
to remove their hands from the keys during practice
hour. So the little fingers diligently worked
up and down, but the counting often gave way
to conversation. Instead of “one-and,” Dolly
might say, in time with her counting, “Don’t
<span class='it'>you</span>,—think <span class='it'>the</span>,—poles <span class='it'>will</span>,—come <span class='it'>to-</span>,—day,
<span class='it'>Dick</span>?” And Dick would pound away, as he
replied, “Yes, <span class='it'>Pat</span>,—said <span class='it'>they</span>,—sure <span class='it'>would</span>,—come
<span class='it'>to</span>,—day<span class='it'>-ay</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus a staccato conversation could be kept up
while the twenty stiff little fingers were acquiring
proper limberness and skill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s enough to drive anybody frantic! I
can’t stand it!” said Aunt Abbie, as one day she
listened to the measured chatter, and its accompaniment
of pounded keys that didn’t chord.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t either!” declared Aunt Rachel, “and
I’ve made up my mind, Abbie, what to do.
We’ll get another piano,—a second-hand one will
do,—and put it up in the playroom. Then they
can practise separately.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ye-es,” said Miss Abbie, doubtfully; “but
they wouldn’t like that. They always want to
be together.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, they’ll have to stand it. It’s enough
to ruin their musical ear, to hear those discords
themselves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s true. I suppose your plan is a good
one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So a second piano was bought, and put up
in the playroom, and the twins had to do their
practising separately, except for a few little duet
exercises, which their teacher kindly gave them.
And it must be confessed they made better progress
than when they combined practising and
social conversation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In addition to the hour for music, Dolly was
required to spend an hour every day, sewing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Misses Dana believed in that old-fashioned
accomplishment, and put the child
through a regular course of overhanding, felling,
and hemming, insisting on great neatness and accuracy
of stitches.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This hour caused Dolly a great many sighs,
and even a few tears. She didn’t like needlework,
and it was <span class='it'>so</span> hard to keep her stitches
even and true.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the real hardship was that Dick didn’t
have to sew also. It didn’t seem fair that she
should work so hard for an hour, while he was
free to play or do what he chose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She remarked this to Aunt Rachel, who saw
the justice of the argument, and thought it over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s true, in a way,” she responded.
“There isn’t any occupation so necessary for a
boy to learn, as for a girl to learn sewing, but
I think that Dick should have a corresponding
task.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So it was arranged that for an hour every day,
Dick must do work in the garden. Real work,
not just fun. He was to weed both his own and
Dolly’s flower-beds, and mow the grass and
trim the hedges in their playground, and water
the plants, if necessary; in short, do the drudgery
work of the garden, while Dolly plodded along
at her sewing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This plan worked finely, and sometimes Dick
had the playground in such perfect order that
he could put in his hour weeding or mowing
the other parts of the lawn. Aunt Rachel
bought a small lawn-mower for his use, and
under Pat’s instructions his hour’s hard work
each day taught him much of the real science of
gardening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the twins had been at Dana Dene a
week, they had as yet made no acquaintances
beside Jack Fuller. This had happened only because
the ladies had not found it convenient
to take the children to call elsewhere, and Dick
and Dolly themselves had been so wrapped up
in their gardens and other joys that they had not
cared for outside companionship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pat had sent for extra long poles, that their
playhouse might be of goodly size. When
these came, and were put in place, the tent-shaped
arbour was about ten feet by twenty,
which was amply large for their purpose. Vines
were planted at once, both seeds and cuttings,
but of course it would be several weeks before
the leaves would form a green roof for them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, the sun was not unpleasantly warm
in May, and by June or July the leafy roof
would be a protection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the meantime, Aunt Abbie, who was most
ingenious, planned a cosy arrangement for them.
In one corner of their playground, Michael built
them a table. This had a section of a felled
tree trunk for an upright, on which was placed a
round top.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the centre of the table top rose a stout,
straight stick, with leather loops nailed on it at
intervals. Into these loops could be thrust the
handle of a very large Japanese umbrella, which,
opened, made a gay and festive-looking roof,
and which could be taken into the house in case
of rain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Benches and rustic chairs Michael made for
them, too, and Dick helped, being allowed to
use his “work-hour” for this.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the playground achieved all these comforts,
it became a most delightful place, and the children
spent whole days there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sometimes, good-natured Hannah would
bring their dinner out there, and let them eat
it under the gay umbrella.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aunt Abbie gave them a fine garden swing,
as she had promised.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was one of those wooden affairs that will
hold four comfortably, but except for Jack
Fuller, none but the twins had yet used it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aunt Rachel’s gift proved to be a fountain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was quite elaborate, and had to be set
up by workmen who came from town for the
purpose. It was very beautiful, and added
greatly to the effect of the playground. When
the weather grew warmer they were to have
goldfish in it, but at present there were aquatic
plants and pretty shells and stones.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was small wonder that the children didn’t
feel need of other companionship, and had it
not been for Jack Fuller, Dolly would never
have thought of being lonely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She and Dick were such good chums that their
company was quite sufficient for each other; but
when Jack came over to play, he and Dick were
quite apt to play boyish games that Dolly didn’t
care for.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On such occasions she usually brought out
her doll-carriage and one or two of her favourite
dolls, and played by herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so, it happened, that one afternoon when
Dick and Jack were playing leap-frog, Dolly
wandered off to the wood with Arabella and
Araminta in the perambulator. She never felt
lonely in the wood, for there were always the
squirrels and birds, and always a chance that she
<span class='it'>might</span> see a fairy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So, with her dolls, she had company enough,
and sitting down by a big flat rock, she set out
a table with acorn cups and leaves for plates,
and tiny pebbles for cakes and fruit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Arabella and Araminta had already been
seated at the table, and Dolly was talking for
them and for herself, as she arranged the
feast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Arabella,” she said; “you can’t have
any jelly pudding to-day, dear, for you are not
very well. You must eat bread and milk, and
here it is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='girl'></a>She set an acorn cup in front of the doll, and
then turned to prepare Araminta’s food, when
she saw a little girl coming eagerly toward her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a pretty little girl, about her own age,
with dark curls, and a pink linen frock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hello,” she said, softly, “I want to play
with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on,” said Dolly, more than pleased to
have company. “Sit right down at the table.
There’s a place. I fixed it for Mr. Grey Squirrel,
but he didn’t come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t bring my doll,” said the little girl
in pink, “I—I came away in a hurry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll lend you one of mine,” said Dolly.
“They’re Arabella and Araminta; take your
choice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s your own name?” said the visitor,
as she picked up Araminta.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dolly,—Dolly Dana. What’s yours?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t want to tell you,” said the little girl,
looking confused.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind,” said Dolly, sorry for her
guest’s evident embarrassment, but thinking her
a very strange person. “I’ll call you Pinkie,
’cause your dress is such a pretty pink.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” said Pinkie, evidently much relieved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re not—you’re not a fairy, are you?”
said Dolly, hopefully, yet sure she wasn’t one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no,” said Pinkie, laughing. “I’m just
a little girl, but I—I ran away, and so I don’t
want to tell you my name.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I don’t care,” said Dolly, who was always
willing to accept a situation. “Never
mind about that. Let’s play house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; let’s. You keep this place, ’cause
you’ve fixed your table so nice, and I’ll live over
here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pinkie selected another choice spot for her
home, and soon the two families were on visiting
terms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly and her daughter, Arabella, went to
call on Pinkie and her daughter, Araminta, and
as they had already selected the names of Mrs.
Vandeleur and Mrs. Constantine, their own
names didn’t matter anyway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly was Mrs. Vandeleur, because she
thought that title had a very grand sound, and
Pinkie chose Mrs. Constantine because she had
just come to that name in her “Outlines of the
World’s History,” and thought it was beautiful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Mrs. Vandeleur rang the bell at Mrs. Constantine’s
mansion, and sent in two green leaves,
which were supposed to be the visiting cards of
herself and her daughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come in, come in,” said Mrs. Constantine,
in a high-pitched voice. “I’m so glad to see
you. Won’t you sit down?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly sat down very elegantly on the root of
a tree, and propped Arabella against another.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m just going to have supper,” said the
hostess, “and I hope you and your daughter
will give me the pleasure of your company.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you. I will stay, but I must go ’way
right after dessert. I have an engagement with—with
the fairies.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, how lovely! Are you going to see them
dance?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Dolly, greatly pleased to learn
that Pinkie believed in fairies; “they sent me
a special invitation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll go with you,” said Mrs. Constantine,
promptly. “I’m always invited to their dances.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So again the acorn cups and leaves came into
use, and the four drank unlimited cups of tea,
and ate all sorts of things, Arabella having apparently
recovered from her indisposition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, we’ll go to the fairies’ ball,” said
Pinkie, as with a sweep of her hand she cleared
the table of dishes and viands and all. “What
shall we wear?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll wear red velvet,” said Dolly, whose
tastes were gay, “and a wide light-blue sash, and
gold slippers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll look lovely,” declared Mrs. Constantine.
“I’ll wear spangled blue satin, and a
diamond crown.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I’ll have a diamond crown, too,” said
Dolly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; you have a ruby one. We don’t want
to be just alike.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I’ll have a ruby one, and my daughter
can have a diamond one, and your daughter a
ruby one,—then we’ll be fair all around.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, that’s fair,” agreed Pinkie; “now let’s
start.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They carried the dolls with them, and going
a little farther into the wood, they selected a
smooth, mossy place where fairies might easily
dance if they chose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We must fix it up for them,” said Pinkie;
“so they’ll want to come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eagerly the two girls went to work. They
picked up any bits of stick or stone that disfigured
the moss, and then, at Pinkie’s direction,
they made a circular border of green leaves, and
what few wild flowers they could find.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A row of stones was laid as an outside border,
and a branch of green was stuck upright in the
centre.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now it looks pretty,” said Pinkie, with a
nod of satisfaction. “Let’s sit down and wait.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will they <span class='it'>really</span> come?” asked Dolly, as
with Araminta and Arabella they seated themselves
near by.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no, I s’pose not,” said Pinkie, with a
little sigh. “I’ve done this thing so many
times, and they never <span class='it'>have</span> come. But it’s fun
to do it, and then I always think perhaps they
<span class='it'>may</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But they waited what seemed a long time, and
as no fairies came to dance, and the shadows
began to grow deeper, Dolly said she must go
home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I must too,” said Pinkie, looking
troubled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See here, Dolly,” she said, as they walked
along; “don’t you want to come here and play
with me again?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“’Course I do,” exclaimed Dolly. “Every
day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you can’t do it, unless you keep it
secret. You mustn’t tell anybody,—not anybody
in the world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not even Dick and the aunties?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, not anybody. If you tell, we can’t play
here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pinkie, <span class='it'>are</span> you a fairy, after all?” said
Dolly, looking at her earnestly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was quite unable, otherwise, to think of
any reason to keep their acquaintance secret.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well—maybe I am,” said Pinkie, slowly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And that’s why you haven’t any name!” exclaimed
Dolly, rapturously. “But I didn’t
s’pose real fairies were so big, and so ’zactly like
little girls.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Real fairies aren’t. I’m just a—just a sort
of a fairy. Oh, Dolly, don’t ask questions.
Only, remember, if you tell anybody about me,
we can’t play here in the woods any more. Will
you promise?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I’ll promise,” said Dolly, solemnly,
awed by Pinkie’s great earnestness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then they separated, and Dolly ran home
with her dolls.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='102' id='Page_102'></span><h1>CHAPTER VIII</h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;font-size:1em;'>A SECRET</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'>D</span>olly was very quiet after she reached
home. She was greatly puzzled at the
events of the afternoon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course,” she thought, “Pinkie <span class='it'>couldn’t</span>
be a fairy. She is just as much a live little girl
as I am. And yet, why should any nice little
girl,—and she surely is a very nice little girl,—want
our acquaintance kept secret?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly remembered a little girl in Chicago, who
loved to have “secrets,” but they were very
simple affairs, usually a new slate pencil, or a
coming birthday party. She had never heard
of such a foolish secret as not telling your name!</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so, the thought <span class='it'>would</span> come back; what
if Pinkie should be a real fairy? To be sure,
she had always thought fairies were tiny folk,
but she had never seen one, so how could she
know?</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Pinkie was so well versed in making a
fairies’ dancing ground, and she appeared so
mysteriously,—apparently from nowhere at all!
Oh, if it should be! And then, that would explain
the secret part of it,—for fairies always
want to be kept secret. But on the other hand,
that pink kilted dress of starched linen! Fairies
always wore gauzy robes, and carried wands, and
had wings. Well, yes, that was the popular
notion, but who had seen them, to know for
sure?</p>

<p class='pindent'>These thoughts chased through Dolly’s mind
as she sat at the supper table, and Aunt Rachel
soon noticed the child’s absorption.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the matter, dearie?” she asked;
“aren’t you well?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, Auntie; I—I was just thinking.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know what’s the matter with Dollums,”
said Dick, a little shamefacedly. “It’s ’cause
Jack Fuller and I played leap-frog and
things she didn’t like, and so she went off
by herself, and was lonesome. I’m sorry,
Dolly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Dick Dana!” exclaimed his twin; “it
wasn’t that a bit! I’m glad you had fun with
Jack, and I didn’t care a spick-speck! I had a
lovely time myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where were you, dear?” asked Aunt Abbie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the wood, with my two big dolls,” said
Dolly, truthfully, but she had a strange feeling
of dishonesty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had never had a secret before; had never
told anything except the <span class='it'>whole</span> truth; and the
<span class='it'>part</span> truth, as she had told it now, troubled her
conscience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet she had promised Pinkie not to tell about
her, so whether Pinkie was fairy or little girl,
Dolly felt herself bound by her promise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Auntie,” she said, after a pause, “are there
really fairies?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, child, of course not. You know there
aren’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I s’pose so. But if there were any,
how big would they be?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t ask silly questions, Dolly. There are
no such beings as fairies.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I don’t know, Aunt Rachel,” put in
Dick. “You know, just because we’ve never
seen any,—that doesn’t prove there aren’t
any.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But how big would they be, Dick?” persisted
Dolly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, little bits of things. A dozen of them
could dance on a toad-stool, I expect.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That settled it in Dolly’s mind. Of course
Pinkie wasn’t a fairy then, for what Dick said
was always so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Aunt Abbie changed the situation. She
had more imagination than Aunt Rachel, and
she idly fell into the discussion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not sure of that, Dick,” she said. “I
always imagine fairies to be about our own
size. You know Cinderella’s fairy godmother
was a grown-up lady.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” said Dolly, her eyes shining with interest.
“Then do you think, Aunt Abbie, that
there could be a little girl fairy, about as big as
me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, yes, I suppose so; if there are fairies at
all. But I’m not sure that there are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would you believe it if you saw one?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, if I were awake, and sure I was not
dreaming.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly stared at Aunt Abbie, as if fascinated by
her words. Then Pinkie <span class='it'>might</span> be a fairy, after
all!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re a queer child, Dolly,” said Aunt
Rachel, looking at the little girl’s perplexed
face. “And when you find your fairies, don’t
bring them in the house, for there’s no knowing
what tricks they may cut up. They’re said to
be mischievous little people.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course they’re little,” argued Dick. “I
think you’re mistaken about Cinderella’s godmother,
Aunt Abbie. I think she was a little
mite of a lady.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps so, Dicky. I’m not much of an
authority on fairy lore, I’ll admit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then, somehow, the matter was dropped,
and nothing more was said about fairies or their
probable size.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But a little later, when the twins were alone
in their playroom, Dolly reopened the subject.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dick,” she began, “why do you think fairies
must be little?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dolly, what’s the matter with you and your
fairies? Why are you bothering so much about
’em all of a sudden?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, nothing; I just want to know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It isn’t nothing! Have you been seeing fairies,
or what? You’ve got to tell me all about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t, Dick.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can’t? Why not, I’d like to know!
We never have secrets from each other. You know
we don’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I can’t tell you about this. I promised.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, unpromise then! Who’d you promise?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t tell you that either.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here, Dolly Dana, who could you
promise not to tell me anything? Was it Pat or
Michael?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then who was it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t tell you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pooh, what a silly! Why, Dolly, we’re
twins,—we always have to tell each other everything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know it, Dick, and I want to tell you,
awful, but you know yourself it’s wrong to
break a promise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you might tell me who you promised
it to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s part of the secret.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oho, it <span class='it'>is</span> a secret, is it? Well, Dolly Dana,
if you’ve got a secret from <span class='it'>me</span>, you can keep it,—<span class='it'>I</span>
don’t care!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was too much for Dolly’s loyal little
twin-heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t want to keep it, Dick; I want to tell
you! But I promised her I wouldn’t, so what
can I do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get her to let you off your promise. I s’pose
it’s Hannah or Delia.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe I can do that,” and Dolly’s face
looked a little brighter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, do; and don’t talk any more
about it, till you can tell me all of it, whatever
it is. Dolly, it isn’t anything wrong,
is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; I don’t see how it can be wrong.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then let up on it, till you’re ready to talk
square. <span class='it'>I</span> never had a secret from <span class='it'>you</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know it; and I’ll never have one from
you again!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So peace was restored, and Dolly said no more
about fairies. But after she was tucked up in
her own little white bed that night, she lay awake
in the darkness for a long time, trying to puzzle
it all out. One minute it would seem too absurd
to think a little girl was a fairy; the next minute,
it would seem just as absurd for a little girl to
appear in the woods like that, and refuse to tell
her name, and insist that their acquaintance be
kept a secret! <span class='it'>That</span> was exactly what a fairy
would do!</p>

<p class='pindent'>So, after reasoning round and round in a
circle, Dolly fell asleep, and dreamed that she
was a fairy herself, with a pink linen dress, and
a pair of wings and a golden wand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next afternoon Jack Fuller was again at
Dana Dene to play with Dick, and again Dolly
trotted off to the woods. She found Pinkie sitting
on a flat stone, waiting for her. The same
pink linen frock, the same straw hat, with pink
rosettes on it, and the same sweet-faced, curly-haired
Pinkie. Dolly was <span class='it'>so</span> glad to see her,
and fairy or mortal, she already loved her better
than any little girl she had ever known.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Pinkie was not so gay and merry as
yesterday. She looked troubled, and Dolly’s
sensitive little heart knew it at once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on,” she said, taking hold of Pinkie’s
hand; “let’s play.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” said Pinkie, “I’ve brought my
own dolls, this time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And sure enough, there were two dolls as
big and beautiful as Arabella and Araminta.
Pinkie said her dolls’ names were Baby Belle
and Baby Bess, and, as it seemed the most
natural thing to do, they began to play tea-party
at once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Dolly wanted, first, to settle the matter of
the secret.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pinkie,” she said, “you’re a really, truly
little girl, aren’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“’Course I am,” said Pinkie, smiling. “I
just said I was a fairy for fun.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; I know it. But I want you to let me
tell about you at home. It’s silly to make a
secret of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, tell ’em, I don’t care. I’m not coming
here to play any more, anyway.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now Dolly looked dismayed. “Why not?”
she asked, and went on without waiting for an
answer. “I won’t tell my aunts, if you don’t
want me to, but I must tell my brother Dick.
He’s my twin, and we never have secrets from
each other. Why, here he comes now!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Running toward them across the field, they
saw the two boys.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is that your brother with Jack Fuller?”
asked Pinkie, and with this recognition of Jack,
Dolly’s last faint hope that Pinkie <span class='it'>might</span> be a
fairy, vanished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; I wonder what they want.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boys had really come in search of Dolly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dick had felt himself rather selfish to play
with Jack, while Dolly had only her dolls for
company, so he had proposed that they go and
find her, and then all play together some games
that she would like. Jack had agreed willingly
enough, so they made for the woods, whither
Dick had seen Dolly go, wheeling her two big
dolls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hello, Phyllis Middleton,” cried Jack,
as he spied Pinkie. “What are you doing
here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The secret was out!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly felt a blank pall of despair fall over
her heart. Pinkie, then, was Phyllis Middleton,
the daughter of the Middletons whom Aunt
Rachel detested, and would have no dealings
with! Indeed, Dolly had been forbidden to
speak to any of the Middletons. And then, as
Dolly’s thoughts flew rapidly on, she realised
that Pinkie had known all this, and that was
why she said if Dolly knew her name they couldn’t
play together any more!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Poor Dolly! Not only to lose her new-made
friend, but to learn that the friend was really a
naughty little girl, who had deliberately done
wrong.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hello, Jack!” said Phyllis. “I know I
ought not to come here, and I’m not coming
again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said Dick, throwing himself down
on the ground; “is this your secret, Dollums?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Dolly, almost ready to cry.
“This is my Pinkie, and I love her, and now
she’s the little girl Aunt Rachel said we couldn’t
play with.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not?” cried Dick, who had forgotten
the Middleton ban.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phyllis took up the story.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know the beginning of it,” she said;
“but my mother, and Miss Rachel Dana don’t
like each other, and won’t go to each other’s
houses. And when I heard a little girl had come
here to live, I wanted to come over, but mother
wouldn’t let me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And Aunt Rachel forbade me to go to your
house, too,” put in Dolly. “I think it’s awful
for grown-up ladies to get mad like that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’ve been mad for lots of years,” said
Jack Fuller. “I’ve heard my mother talk about
it to the other ladies. They call it the Dana-Middleton
feud.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What was it about?” asked Dick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nobody knows,” replied Jack. “At least,
none of us children. Of course, when there
weren’t any children at the Dana house, we didn’t
care anything about it; but now, it’s pretty if
you two can’t play with the Middletons! Why,
they go to our parties and our school and our
Sunday school, and our picnics and everything!
I guess Miss Dana and Mrs. Middleton’ll have
to make up now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They won’t,” said Phyllis, mournfully. “I
heard mother and father talking about it. And
they said I mustn’t come over here, or speak to
Dolly or anything. And then, yesterday, I did
come over here to the wood,—it’s right next to
our last orchard,—and Dolly and I had such
fun, I thought I’d come every day, and not tell
anybody. But after I went to bed last night,
I thought about it, and I know it’s wrong; so I’m
not going to do it any more. I just came to-day
to tell Dolly so. And after I go home, I’m
going to confess to mother about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phyllis’s eyes were full of tears, and as she
finished speaking, and Dolly’s arms went round
her, both girls cried in their mutual affliction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boys were highly indignant at the whole
situation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a shame!” cried Dick. “If Aunt
Rachel wants to be mad at Mrs. Middleton,
let her; but I don’t see why they shouldn’t let
Phyllis and Dolly be friends. Have you got any
brothers, Phyllis?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only a little one, six years old,” was the
reply. “There’s just the two of us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you live just next house to us,” went on
Dick. “You and Dolly could have lovely times
together. I’m going to ask Aunt Rachel myself
if you two can’t be friends.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It wouldn’t do any good,” said Phyllis, wiping
her eyes. “She wouldn’t give in, and, even
if she did, my mother wouldn’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’m going to try it, anyway,” stoutly
persisted Dick. “It can’t do any harm, and if
Aunt Rachel <span class='it'>should</span> give in, she might persuade
your mother, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phyllis looked a little hopeful at this, but
Dolly said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aunt Rachel won’t let me play with you; I
know it. She has said so a dozen times, and she’s
awful stubborn. But I’m glad you told, Pinkie,
’cause it wouldn’t have been right for us to play
together and not tell.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I know it,” agreed Phyllis. “I would
have told you yesterday, only it was so funny
when you thought I was a fairy! I thought I’d
pretend I was one, and that would take away the
wrong. But it didn’t, and when I thought all
about it, I knew we couldn’t keep on that
way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Dana twins were conscientious children,
and they were both glad when Phyllis talked
like this; for it had been a shock to Dolly to discover
Pinkie’s deceit, and she felt relieved to
learn that it was only impulsive and quickly repented
of. But this didn’t alter the sad fact
that the two little girls could not be playmates.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s just horrid!” said Dolly, her tears welling
up afresh. “We could have such lovely
times together! Playing dolls, and tea-parties,
and everything. I think Aunt Rachel is mean!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think so, too,” said Jack Fuller, “and I
do believe you could coax her into letting you
two girls play together, even if the grown-up
ladies don’t make up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe we could,” said Dick, hopefully, but
Phyllis shook her head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mother wouldn’t, even if Miss Dana did,”
she repeated. “I was a naughty girl to come
here at all. I wish I hadn’t; then I wouldn’t
have known how nice Dolly was.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again the little girls wept, and the boys looked
at them helplessly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, anyway,” said Dick, at last, “I’m
going home to have a try at it. I’m going
straight to Aunt Rachel and tell her all about
it. It may make a difference, now that you girls
really have met.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” said Phyllis, but she showed no
hope of Dick’s success.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say,” exclaimed Jack, “let’s all go! I
mean, let’s take Phyllis, and all go to Miss
Rachel and ask her about it. If she sees the
two girls crying to beat the band, it may soften
her some.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It seemed a daring proposition, but the twins
approved of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, do,” cried Dolly, eagerly. “Come on,
Pinkie, let’s go right now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t,” said Pinkie, firmly. “Mother
told me never to go to Miss Dana’s house for
anything at all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>No amount of coaxing would prevail, and matters
seemed at a deadlock, until Dick exclaimed:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you stay here, and I’ll go get Auntie
Rachel and make her come out here right
now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It won’t do any good,” moaned Phyllis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know, about your mother. But maybe, if
Miss Rachel gives in first, she can persuade your
mother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe,” said Phyllis, worn out with the
conflict. “Go on if you want to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Dick went.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is the matter, Dick?” she exclaimed.
“Has anything happened to Dolly? Has she
hurt herself?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; she hasn’t hurt herself; but come,
please, Aunt Rachel,—do!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Throwing a light shawl round her, Miss
Rachel went with Dick, quite sure that some
accident had befallen Dolly. It was quite a
little walk to the woods, and Dick began to
wonder whether Phyllis would have waited, or
whether she would have become scared and
gone home. She seemed like a timid little thing,
and Dick well knew that Miss Rachel’s anger
was a formidable thing to brave. He felt far
from calm himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where are you taking me?” said Aunt
Rachel, as they crossed the orchard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To the woods,” replied Dick, briefly;
“Dolly is there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Aunt Rachel said no more, but walked
rapidly along by Dick’s side, her mind full of
horrible imaginings of Dolly, perhaps fallen
from a tree, or in some other dreadful plight.
When she reached the wood she saw the two
little girls, seated on the flat stone, their arms
about each other, and their faces red and tear-stained.
Indeed, the big tears even now rolled
down Dolly’s cheeks, as she saw the stern expression
that came over Aunt Rachel’s face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Phyllis Middleton!” exclaimed the angry-looking
lady; “what does this mean? You
know you are forbidden to step foot on my
property!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes’m,” began Phyllis, timidly, but Dick
took the helm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aunt Rachel,” he said, “I asked you to
come out here, ’cause Phyllis wouldn’t go to the
house. And I want to ask you to let her
be Dolly’s friend; they love each other a
heap.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Aunt Rachel’s wrath was turned toward
her niece.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dolly,” she said, severely, “you know I
positively forbade you to speak to Phyllis Middleton.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Auntie; b-but I didn’t know it was
Phyllis, when I first spoke to her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you know it now. Come away from
her at once. Phyllis, go straight home, and
don’t ever dare come here again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The case was hopeless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phyllis withdrew herself from Dolly’s embrace,
and rose to go away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jack Fuller stood by, unable to help, and very
nearly crying himself in sympathy with the two
forlorn little girls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aunt Rachel, in her surprise and indignation,
had seated herself on the edge of a big stone,
opposite Dolly and Phyllis, and sat with frowning
face, waiting for the unwelcome visitor to
depart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In her extremity of despair, Dolly had an inspiration.
With a cry of, “Oh, <span class='it'>please</span>, Auntie
Rachel!” she sprang at her aunt, and threw her
arms around the neck of the irate lady. She
squeezed her until she nearly choked her; she
showered kisses on her face and neck; she whispered
in her ear, “Please, dear Auntie, oh,
<span class='it'>please</span> let me have her for my little friend; I
love her so! <span class='it'>Please</span>, Auntie!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dick, anxiously watching Miss Rachel’s face,
saw a change. Not only did it become warm
and red from the strangling hugs she was undergoing,
but he felt sure there was a relenting expression
in her eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Partly out of gratitude for this, and partly
from a desire to further Dolly’s cause, he too
rushed at his aunt, and added his affectionate
demonstrations to those of his sister. His
arms somehow found room, too, round her neck,
and he industriously kissed the other side of her
face, while he cried, “<span class='it'>Please</span>, Auntie Rachel,
even if you don’t like the Middletons, please let
Phyllis and Dolly be friends! <span class='it'>Please</span>, Auntie!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So cyclonic was the beginning of this performance,
and so vigorous its continuance, that
Miss Rachel was soon on the verge of physical
collapse, and wildly waved her hands, in a
futile endeavour to shake off the besiegers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phyllis and Jack were appalled at the
scene, and were almost uncertain whether the
attack was really affectionate or of a hostile
nature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For gracious’ sake, Dolly, <span class='it'>do</span> stop!” cried
Miss Rachel, at last, as her glasses flew off, and
her carefully arranged coiffure became a wreck.
“Dick, let go of me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Auntie,” he said, kneeling at one side,
and possessing himself of one of her hands, while
Dolly did the same with the other; “but, Auntie,
do say yes, won’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Won’t you, Auntie?” echoed Dolly; “won’t
you, Auntie? Please, dear Auntie Rachel, won’t
you? <span class='it'>Please!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The words, repeated so often, seemed to become
meaningless, but not so the beseeching
expression on the two upturned, pleading little
faces.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aunt Rachel looked at them,—Dick’s eager
hopeful gaze; Dolly’s tearful, despairing eyes,—and
her hard heart melted.</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='gardA'></a></p>

<div class='figcenter'>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>She put an arm round each of the quivering
little bodies, and said softly:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait a minute, dears, let me think it
over.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>If Miss Rachel needed further incentive, the
joy that flashed into the twins’ faces must have
given it to her, for she went on almost immediately:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You cannot understand the grown-up part
of this; you cannot be told about why Mrs. Middleton
and I are not on friendly terms; but this
I will grant. If Phyllis’s mother will let her
be Dolly’s friend, I shall be glad to have it so.
If Phyllis is allowed to come to Dana Dene,
Dolly may also visit her and you may play together
all you like. There is really no reason
why you children should suffer for the sake of
your elders, and I see that clearly now. Come
here, Phyllis.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phyllis rose and went to Miss Rachel, who
looked her over with evident interest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are a nice child,” she said, at last,
with a nod of approval. “I shall be glad to
have you become Dolly’s friend. Do you think
your mother will object?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know she will, Miss Dana,” said Phyllis,
sadly; “I am sure she won’t let me go to Dana
Dene.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I shall go to see her, myself, and I
fancy I can persuade her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Rachel said this with a majestic air,
yet with a grim smile, and the children felt
that though they certainly did not understand
the “grown-up part of it,” yet their cause was
won, and Dolly and Phyllis would be permitted
to play together to their hearts’ content.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, Miss Rachel,” said Phyllis,
timidly taking her hand, and feeling that she
ought to show her gratitude by some demonstration,
after the example set her by the twins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Rachel kissed her gently on the forehead,
and then put her hand in Dolly’s; bidding the
two little girls seal their friendship with a kiss,
and then say good-bye until to-morrow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Scamper home, across the orchard, Phyllis,”
she went on, “and tell your mother all about it,
if you choose; and say I shall call on her this
evening.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jack went with Phyllis, as that was the way
toward his own home, and the three Danas
went back to the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Auntie, you are so good,” said Dolly,
as, with her arm round her aunt’s waist, she
walked by her side. “It was lovely of you to
give up your favourite feud for me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Rachel smiled at Dolly’s choice of words,
but she only said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is right, dearie. It would be very foolish
to keep you two little girls apart because of what
happened to your ancestors, twenty years ago.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes’m; and are you going to keep on feuding
with Mrs. Middleton?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know yet,” said Miss Rachel, smiling
again; “if I do, it will be because she insists
upon it. But I feel sure I can persuade her
to feel as I do, about you children.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re a brick, Auntie,” declared Dick,
who walked at her other side. “I was ’most
sure you’d cave in when you saw how the girls
felt about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was really the way you two felt about
it, that persuaded me; indeed, if I hadn’t ‘caved
in,’ as you call it, I think you would have
squeezed me to pieces.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, we’re good coaxers,” said Dick, modestly.
“We used to coax Auntie Helen that
way; but she always got to laughing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It wasn’t a humorous occasion, to-day,” said
Aunt Rachel, and then they all went in to
supper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aunt Abbie, who was wondering what had become
of them, was then told the whole story,
which greatly interested her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And now,” said Dolly, as everything had
been explained, “you see why I was asking about
fairies last night. I didn’t really think Phyllis
was a fairy, but she came so—so unexpected,
you know, and she wouldn’t tell me her name,
and she told me to keep it all a secret.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think that part of it was a little naughty,”
said Aunt Abbie, judicially.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes’m,” agreed Dolly. “But you see she
’pented, and to-day she came to tell me that
she had ’cided it <span class='it'>was</span> naughty, and she wasn’t
coming any more. So that took away the
naughtiness, didn’t it, Auntie Rachel?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I think it did, dearie. I feel sure
Phyllis is a conscientious little girl, and will be a
good friend for you in every way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I’ll always call her Pinkie,” said Dolly;
“’cause I called her that at first, and Phyllis is
such a grown-up name. Will you go over and
see about it right away, Auntie?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“After a while, Dolly. But I shall not return
until after you’ve gone to bed, so don’t think
any more about it till morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aunt Rachel spoke calmly, but the children
little knew what it meant to her to subdue her
pride and make the advance toward a truce with
Mrs. Middleton. Their quarrel, though it had
occurred many years ago, was as bitter as ever,
and reconciliation seemed impossible. Neither
had ever been willing to suggest such a thing,
and though kind-hearted friends had tried to
bring it about, their efforts had met with no
success. Miss Abbie was, of course, amazed at
the way things were going, but her offer to accompany
her sister was met with a gentle but
decided refusal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so, nobody ever knew what passed between
the two neighbours that evening. Whatever
way she humiliated herself, or whatever
arguments she used, Miss Rachel never told;
but, at least, her main errand was successful, and
Mrs. Middleton agreed to let Phyllis and Dolly
play together all they liked, and visit at each
other’s homes whenever they chose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As for the two ladies themselves, they didn’t
at once forgive and forget all of their long-standing
unpleasantness, but they agreed to be, at
least, calling acquaintances, for the children’s
sake; and I may as well say here that eventually
the breach was healed, and by degrees they
became really friendly neighbours.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly was too excited and anxious to sleep, so
when she heard Miss Rachel come in, though it
was late, she sprang out of bed, and throwing
a blue kimono over her little frilled nightgown,
she ran out into the hall, and called down over
the banisters:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it all right, Auntie Rachel? Is it all
right?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, it’s all right, Dolly. Go back to bed,
you’ll catch cold.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>By this time, Dick had bounced out of his
room. A bath-robe was round him, over his
pink-striped pajamas, and as he heard Aunt
Rachel’s assurance that their cause was won, he
whispered to Dolly, “Let’s go down and hug
her!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s!” replied Dolly, and the two bare-footed,
dressing-gowned little figures flew downstairs
and precipitated themselves upon the already
exhausted lady.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t, children!” cried Aunt Abbie, as Miss
Rachel was almost lost to sight in clouds of
eider-down flannel, and four eager, waving arms.
“Don’t! you’ll wear Auntie Rachel out, she’s almost
collapsed now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Abbie; let them be. I like it,” gasped
Aunt Rachel, from behind two curly heads that
seemed to be devouring her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Aunt Abbie only laughed, inwardly rejoicing
that the children had brought about an
amicable adjustment of the old quarrel, and glad,
too, that her reserved and undemonstrative sister
enjoyed the wild antics of the two little savages.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Auntie Abbie next!” shouted Dick, gleefully,
and Aunt Rachel received a respite, as the
twins’ attentions were showered upon their other
aunt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she wouldn’t stand quite so much.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Be off with you!” she cried. “You’re
worse than a pair of little bear-cubs!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are bear-cubs,” cried Dick, enchanted
with the suggestion. Then he growled, and
pawed and clawed at Aunt Abbie, winding up
with a hug that nearly cracked her bones.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly, always ready to take her cue, was also
a bear-cub, and between them they made Aunt
Abbie’s life miserable for a few minutes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Scamper now!” she cried, as she emerged,
laughing, from the latest onslaught. “Run to
bed, both of you. I’ve had enough of this!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So, with final pats and kisses all round, the
twins went upstairs, and were soon snugly in
bed once more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly thought she should never go to sleep,
she was so happy in the thoughts of her new
friend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dear Pinkie! She was so pretty and sweet,
and Dolly smiled to herself at thought of all the
fun they could have playing together. They
would always be friends, even after they grew
up to be young ladies, and they would never have
a foolish quarrel, as Pinkie’s mother and Auntie
Rachel had had. And so, fairly revelling in
happy anticipations, Dolly fell asleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Downstairs, the two sisters talked long and
earnestly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a blessing those two children ever came
here,” said Miss Abbie, at last.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is a blessing in some ways,” said Miss
Rachel, “but they’re going to be a terrible responsibility.
Such overflowing spirits I never
saw! They can’t be still a second. And we
must stop these fearful tornadoes of affection!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I thought you enjoyed them!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do enjoy their hearty demonstrations and
endearments. They’re so real and spontaneous.
But we must curb them, for it isn’t good for the
children to be allowed such savagery. For it is
savagery.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is, indeed!” agreed Aunt Abbie, ruefully.
“My arm’s lame yet, from their squeezing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, we’ll correct them. But I don’t want
to be too harsh, poor little motherless things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, and fatherless, too. We must be very
good to them, Rachel, but it isn’t true kindness
to be too indulgent, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, of course not. We must be firm, yet
gentle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so the two ladies discussed the management
of the twins, not realising at all, that on
the contrary, the twins were managing them!
For though good and obedient children, Dick
and Dolly generally succeeded in getting their
own sweet way, as witness the case of Phyllis
Middleton.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='132' id='Page_132'></span><h1>CHAPTER X</h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;font-size:1em;'>AN AUCTION SALE</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'>L</span>ife at Dana Dene settled down into a
pleasant routine that was in no sense
monotony. Every day the sewing and the
practising and the gardening had their appointed
hours. But this left hours and hours of play-time,
and the twins improved them all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phyllis and Dolly were very chummy little
companions, and scarcely a day passed without
their seeing each other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dick and Jack Fuller were chums too, and
though the twins became acquainted with many
of the other children in Heatherton, they liked
these earliest made friends best of all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Often they went to town, for Dana Dene was
about a mile out from the village itself. Sometimes
they drove in state with the aunties, or
perhaps less formally, on morning errands.
Sometimes they rode on the big spring wagon
with Pat or Michael, and sometimes on pleasant
days, they walked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One delightful afternoon, the aunties had gone
to sewing society, and the twins were holding a
consultation as to what would be the most fun
for them to do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s walk to town and get some soda
water,” suggested Dolly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” returned Dick; “but we needn’t
walk unless we want to. Michael’s going down
with the wagon. But he isn’t ready yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, let’s walk on, and then when he comes
along we can get in, if we want to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, and we can ride home, anyway.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So after arranging with Michael to look out
for them on the way, Dick and Dolly started
off. They loved to walk to town, for there was
so much of interest along the way. The first
part, more or less wooded, showed various enticing
spots to sit down and rest a while.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Squirrels were apt to come round and be
sociable, or birds would sing little songs of greeting
from the branches. There were always new
wild-flowers, and just now the wild roses were
opening, and daisies were in bloom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, if they were very cautious, there was always
a chance of seeing fairies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now that Pinkie was understood, Dolly returned
to her original idea of fairies,—tiny,
fragile beings, with wings and wands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dick had some doubts as to their existence, but
was always on the alert to catch sight of them
in the woods.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, after the woodsy part was passed, came
the beginnings of the streets, with houses few
and far apart; and then the bridge,—always a
fine place to linger,—and then houses closer together,
many of which were good stopping-places,
and finally the business portion of the
little town itself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here were fascinating shops, with windows
delightfully full of tempting wares, also a
caterer’s shop, where one could choose between
cakes and ice cream, or candy and soda water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The twins were allowed fifty cents apiece each
week for spending money. With this, they
could do exactly as they chose, with the stipulation
that not more than ten cents in one day
should be spent for edibles. As they conscientiously
obeyed this rule, the aunts felt sure they
could not seriously harm their digestion. And,
besides, they did not buy sweets every time they
went to town. Sometimes it was marbles or
tops or ribbons for dolls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On this particular occasion the twins felt
specially rich, for they each had an untouched
half dollar just given them by Aunt Rachel,
and they had also a goodly portion of the
previous week’s income still unspent. Not that
they expected necessarily to spend it, but it
seemed pleasant to have their fund with them,
and if they should see anything very desirable
they might purchase it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So they trudged along, with open minds,
ready to accommodate anything that offered in
the way of interest or pleasure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they reached the main street they saw a
great crowd of people in front of one of the
shops, and wondered what the reason might be.
Coming nearer, they saw a red flag waving
over the door, and Dick exclaimed:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, it’s an auction! I never saw one
before; come on, Dolly, let’s go in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So in the twins went, and soon became greatly
interested in the proceedings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They edged through the crowd, until they
were quite near the auctioneer, and then they
listened, spellbound, to his discourse. Never
having seen an auction sale before, the manner
of conducting it appealed to them, and they
breathlessly watched and listened as one lot
after another was sold to the bidders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The stock was that of a clothing emporium,
and consisted of ready-made suits for both men
and women.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d like to buy something that way,” said
Dick to his sister, “but they’re only grown-ups’
clothes, and anyway, they cost too much. If
they put up anything small I’m going to bid.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe they’ll have handkerchiefs or something
like that,” suggested Dolly, eager also to
join the game of bidding.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But there were no small articles for sale, nothing
but men’s suits and ladies’ costumes, so Dick
and Dolly lost hope of being able to bid for
anything.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They wandered round the place, meeting several
people whom they knew, and who spoke
pleasantly to them. But they were all grown-ups,—there
were no children there but the
twins, so hand in hand they wandered about,
always drifting back to hear the auctioneer crying
out:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ten,—ten,—do I hear eleven?” or “Going,
going—gone!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They listened carefully to his phraseology,
for they well knew “auction” would be one
of their favourite games in the near future, and
Dick wanted to learn the lingo, so that he could
play auctioneer after the most approved fashion.
At last the sale was about over, and the audience
began to go away. Only a few men remained,
and the fixtures of the shop were then
put up. Office furniture, show-cases and such
things were sold quickly, and then was put up
a lot of wax tailors’ dummies. These wax figures,
both men and women, were so comical that
Dick and Dolly laughed aloud to see them put
up for sale. It was almost like selling people.
But the man who bought them didn’t seem
to think it funny at all. He bid them in,
like any other merchandise, but he refused
to take one of them, saying it was too badly
damaged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This unfortunate one was a wax-faced lady
whose cheek was badly dented and marred, thus
making her undesirable as a window attraction.
She was carelessly set aside, and the twins looked
at her with curiosity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dick,” whispered Dolly, “I’d love to have
her! She’d be more fun than a big doll. Do
you s’pose we could get her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I dunno. It would be fun! We could rig
her up, and set her up in the playground. How
much money have you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just seventy-seven cents.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I have eighty-six. Let’s ask the man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Dick stepped up to the auctioneer, and
said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Could you auction up that other wax lady,
sir?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That one, kid? Why, she’s no good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not for a shopman, I know, but—if she
didn’t cost so much, we’d like to have her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You would! Well, you’re two pretty nice
little children, suppose I give her to you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dick hesitated. It seemed too great a favour,
and beside he wanted the fun of bidding.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you see,” he said, “I think we’d
rather pay, if it isn’t too much, because,—you
see,—we want to do that calling out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oho! You want the real auctioneering
game, do you? Well, I’ll have her put up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The auctioneer was a jolly, good-natured man,
and as his task was about over, he felt inclined to
humour the children.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here,” he called to his assistant, “put up
that golden-haired goddess.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Appreciating the situation, the man set the
wax dummy upon the platform.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here you are!” cried the auctioneer.
“What am I bid for this lovely lady? Though
slightly marred in the face, she has a good
heart, and is warranted good-tempered and kind.
What am I bid?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dick hesitated; now that the time had come
he felt suddenly shy, and felt uncertain how
much to offer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ten cents!” came a voice from another
part of the room. Then Dick felt that he was
really in the business at last, and he called out
sturdily:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fifteen!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fifteen,” echoed the auctioneer. “Fifteen!
do I hear any more? Only fifteen cents for
this beautiful work of art?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Twenty!” called the other voice, and for
some reason the auctioneer scowled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Twenty!” he cried; “twenty? Do I hear
twenty-five?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Twenty-five!” cried Dick, his face all aglow
with the excitement of the moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Twenty-five!” sang out the auctioneer.
“Twenty-five! Is there another bid?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the menacing face he turned toward the
other bidder must have silenced him, for he said
no more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Twenty-five!” went on the auctioneer, quite
gaily now. “Twenty-five! That seems too
<a id='cheap'></a>cheap for this Prize Beauty. Twenty-five! Is
that all?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It <span class='it'>did</span> seem too cheap, and Dick suddenly
felt that it ought to bring more. Besides, the
auctioneer’s voice was persuasive, and so, still
in the spirit of the game, Dick cried out,
“Thirty!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The auctioneer suddenly choked, and the man
in the back of the room burst into shouts of
laughter, but Dick didn’t mind now. With shining
eyes, he awaited the auctioneer’s next move,
and seeing this, the smiling gentleman went on:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thirty! Thirty cents for this Darling
Dame. She looks like that! Do I hear any
more? Thirty—going—going——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thirty-five!” said Dolly, timidly, but in
clear tones.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dick looked at her admiringly. Dolly <span class='it'>was</span>
a trump. He was glad she had a part in the
great game too.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thirty-five!” called the auctioneer, red in
the face, but preserving his gravity. “Thirty-five!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Forty!” cried Dick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Forty-five!” said Dolly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fifty!” yelled Dick, smiling at his sister.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fifty-five,” she cried, smiling back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stop!” cried the auctioneer, “you two
mustn’t bid against each other!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not?” asked Dick. “We have the
money. We’ve more ’n a dollar ’n’ a half, together.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, but one of you can buy this thing if
you really want it. So stop bidding, and take it
for fifty cents.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” agreed Dick, “we’ll each pay
twenty-five.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This plan suited Dolly, and the money was
paid at once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have to take your goods with you, you
know,” said the auctioneer, not unkindly, as he
watched the two delighted children.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, we will,” said Dolly. “Michael’s outside
somewhere, with the big wagon. He’ll take
us all home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You stay here with the lady, Dolly,” said
Dick, “and I’ll run out and hunt Michael.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go on,” said the auctioneer, “I’ll look after
Miss Dolly and her new friend both.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The auctioneer had children of his own, and
was greatly interested in his two young customers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you want of this affair?” he asked
Dolly, after Dick had gone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To play with,” she returned. “I know we
can dress her up and have lots of fun with her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps I can find you some clothes for
her here,” he offered; “she ought to have a
hat and shawl.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, never mind,” said Dolly, easily; “we’ll
take her home, and I think Aunt Rachel’s clothes
will fit her. If not, we’ll try Hannah’s.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wax lady was simply robed in a drab
muslin slip, whose plainness contrasted strangely
with the bright pink of her complexion, the large
mop of yellow hair, and the waxen forearms—except
for her head, neck, and forearms the
lady was a sort of wire frame, more or less bent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Dolly saw wondrous possibilities, and
cared not at all that her ladyship was so imperfectly
arrayed at present.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dick soon returned, and announced that Michael
was outside in the wagon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The auctioneer’s obliging assistant carried the
wax lady to the door, and then the twins took it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The saints preserve us!” cried Michael;
“whativer have ye rascally babies been up to
now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ve bought a lady, Michael,” explained
Dolly, “and we want to take her home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, if so be as she’s your lady, home with
us she must go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Michael climbed down from his seat, and
assisted the “lady” into the wagon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s lyin’ down in the wagon she must ride,”
he said. “I’ll have no waxen image a-settin’ up
on the seat, an’ me, like as not, arristed fer kid-nappin’
her! In she goes, and covered up wid
these potaty-sacks she’ll be, till yez gets her
home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” said Dolly, gleefully, “I don’t
care. Put her in back, if you want to. But be
careful, don’t muss up her hair too much!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last the “lady” was arranged, and Dick
and Dolly clambered up to the seat beside Michael,
and home they went.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see,” Dolly confided to Michael, who
was her devoted adorer, “we went to an auction,
and we bought the lady.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An auction! Yez childher! My soul! what
will yez be afther doin’ next?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It isn’t hard to go to an auction,” said Dick,
meditatively. “You just find what you want to
buy; and then you see how much money you’ve
got, and then you bid till you get up to it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yis, that’s a foine way!” said Michael,
appreciatively. “An’ yez chose the wax scarecrow,
did yez? Well, give it to me fer my cornfield,
it’ll be foine to kape the burrds off!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You bad Michael,” said Dolly. “You’re
just teasing us. Scarecrow! Why, she’s my new
doll. I’m going to call her,—what shall we call
her, Dick?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lady Eliza Dusenbury,” said Dick,
promptly, for he was always quick at choosing
names. “And I say, Dolly, let’s rig her up,
hat and all, you know, and stand her up in front
of the front door, and ring the bell, and then
hide, and see what Hannah’ll do!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right; don’t you tell, Michael.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Miss Dolly, I’ll not tell.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you help us, Michael, to get her out and
get her fixed up, will you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<a id='yis'></a>Yis, I’ll help yez, ye good-fer-nothin’
shcamps.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Michael indulged in calling them
names, the twins knew he was very good-natured
indeed, so they anticipated great fun.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When they reached Dana Dene, the two children
jumped down from the wagon and ran into
the house. It was easy enough to get in unnoticed,
and they went straight to Aunt Rachel’s
room for clothing for the new friend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly selected a pretty street suit of dark-blue
pongee, made with a coat and skirt. She found
also a white waist, and a blue hat trimmed with
cornflowers. This was really enough, but she
added a veil and a small shopping bag. With
these things, the twins hurried to the barn, where
Michael had the Lady Eliza waiting for them
in the carriage house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly dressed her, and it was surprising how
distinguished she looked in Aunt Rachel’s costume.
It seemed a very good fit, and the flower-trimmed
hat was most becoming to the frizzled
yellow hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On account of the scar on her cheek, Dolly put
on the thin lace veil, which really added to her
modish effect. Her arms, which were movable,
were adjusted at an elegant angle, and the shopping
bag was hung on her left wrist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pat had been taken into confidence, and when
all was ready the children ran ahead to make
sure that the coast was clear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Discovering that Hannah and Delia were
both in the back part of the house, they signalled
to Michael, and he and Pat assisted Lady Eliza
to the front door. Then Dolly adjusted her
hands, and in the right one, which was extended,
she placed a visiting card, taken at random from
the basket in the hall. Then Michael and Pat
went away, Dolly hid in some nearby bushes,
and Dick, after a loud ring at the doorbell, flew,
to join Dolly in her hiding-place.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;font-size:1em;'>FUN WITH LADY ELIZA</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'>H</span>annah, in her white cap and apron,
came at once and opened the door. Being
a well-trained maid, she stepped
back, and held the door open for the lady to
enter, but as the caller did not seem inclined to
do so, but persistently held out her card, Hannah
took it, saying, “The ladies are not at home,
madam.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still the caller stood motionless, and Hannah
looked at her with some curiosity. The lace veil
so shrouded her features that they were not very
discernible, but when Hannah’s glance fell on
the rigid, pale hand, she gave a scream:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My sakes, ma’am! is it dead ye are, or
fainted?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not being able to grasp at once the truth of
the matter, Hannah took the two cold hands in
her own, and shook the lady slightly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lady Eliza toppled over, and would have
fallen to the floor, but that Hannah caught her
in her arms, and dragged her into the hall, where
she dropped her on a large sofa.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Delia!” she called, flying to the kitchen,
“fetch some water. There’s a lady fainted!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dick and Dolly, unable to restrain themselves
longer, came running in, and met Hannah, who
returned, followed by Delia with a bowl of
water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hurry up, Hannah,” cried Dick. “She’s in
an awful faint! Can’t you bring her to?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly was dancing around the prostrate form
of the visitor, and Michael and Pat were peeping
in at the front door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, ye scallywags!” cried Delia, realising
that some mischief was up. “What are ye up
to, now? Who’s this leddy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So lifelike was the whole effect of the figure,
that Delia could not at first take in the fraud.
But when she did, she went off in peals of laughter,
and Hannah joined in heartily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aren’t ye the smart scamps, now!” cried
Delia, proud of the latest exploit of the children.
“An’ will ye look now, Hannah? That’s Miss
Rachel’s best blue dress! I’m wonderin’ ye
didn’t recognise it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never thought,” said Hannah, still gazing
half-fearfully at the figure on the sofa. “I took
it for granted it was a friendly visitor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whereupon Dick outspread Lady Eliza’s
arms in such a comical way, that Delia went off
again in fresh bursts of laughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now to fool the aunties,” said Dick, after
the servants had returned to their work and
Dick and Dolly were left alone with their
new possession. “How shall we fix it up,
Dollums?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly considered. She was more ingenious
than Dick in arranging dramatic effects, and at
last she said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think we’ll just have her seated in a corner
of the veranda, and then, when the aunties come
home, I’ll tell them there’s a lady waiting to
see them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, that’ll be fine; let’s fix her now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Lady Eliza Dusenbury was gracefully
seated in a piazza chair. Upon her knees lay an
open magazine, held in place with one slender
pink hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Those hands give her away, Dolly,” said
Dick. “They don’t look a bit real.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Neither they don’t,” agreed Dolly; “I’ll
get gloves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She ran upstairs and down again, bringing a
pair of light kid gloves from Aunt Rachel’s
room, which she succeeded in getting on the
Lady Eliza’s hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s a heap better,” said Dick; “now,
with the veil, and as its getting sort of darkish,
I don’t see how they’ll suspect at all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Quietly the Lady Eliza sat waiting. Not
quite so quietly, Dick and Dolly sat on the top
step of the veranda, waiting also, and at last
Michael, who had gone after the Dana ladies,
drove them up to the steps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had been charged by the twins not to
mention their new acquisition, so, of course, had
not done so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dick and Dolly met their aunts, with a smiling
welcome, and then Dolly said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s a lady to see you, Aunt Rachel; as
you weren’t home when she came, she sat down,
over there to wait.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In her pleasant, dignified way, Miss Rachel
crossed the veranda, followed by Miss Abbie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Though the ladies had slightly relaxed their
“society” manner when greeting the twins, they
instantly assumed it again as they went to meet
their visitor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-afternoon,” said Miss Rachel as she
neared the lady reading the magazine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the stranger did not look up, and Miss
Rachel assumed she had not heard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you do?” she said, in louder tones,
and held out her hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Abbie also approached, and said “Good-afternoon,”
and extended her hand, but apparently
the visitor had no intention of stopping
her reading.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With no thought other than that the lady
was deaf or exceedingly preoccupied, Miss
Rachel stepped nearer, and said very loudly:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-afternoon!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still no response, and now Miss Rachel became
frightened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She has had a stroke or something,” she exclaimed,
and, stooping, she peered into the
stranger’s face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Abbie! her cheek is hurt! Somebody
has struck her, or thrown a stone at her. How
dreadful!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Abbie fluttered about.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Rachel! How awful! What shall we
do? Call for help, but don’t let the children
come here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, let us come,” cried Dick, as he and
Dolly danced toward the group. “Let us come,
she’s our friend; she’s Lady Eliza Dusenbury.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean?” cried Miss Rachel.
“This lady has been hurt somehow. Go and call
Hannah. Or perhaps we had better send Michael
for a doctor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, don’t, Aunt Rachel,” said Dolly, who
was now shrieking with laughter. “Lady Eliza
isn’t much hurt. But isn’t she a dear!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly threw her arms round the strange lady’s
neck, and patted the injured cheek gently.
Magazine and shopping bag slid to the floor, but
otherwise, the stranger made no motion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dolly, behave yourself!” cried Aunt Abbie.
“What do you mean by such actions? Let
the poor lady be! Oh, what shall we do,
Rachel?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Aunt Rachel had begun to see daylight.
The irrepressible mirth of the two children told
her that there was a joke somewhere, and then,
as she recognised her own dress and hat, she
suspected the truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“H’m,” she said; “suppose we take off the
poor lady’s veil, and see how much she is hurt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Suppose we do,” said Dolly, and she obligingly
assisted her aunt to remove the veil from
Lady Eliza’s beautiful, but scarred face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well!” she exclaimed as she saw the glass
eyes and the pink wax face, “what <span class='it'>have</span> you two
been up to, now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As for Aunt Abbie, she sank down on a nearby
chair, helpless with laughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Aunt Rachel followed her example, and
Dick and Dolly danced round the three seated
figures, while they screamed themselves hoarse
with glee.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They moved Lady Eliza’s arms into threatening
and despairing poses, each more ridiculous
than the other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They took off her hat, and breaking bunches
of wistaria from the veranda vine, they wreathed
her golden mop of hair with them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They took Aunt Rachel’s eyeglasses from the
little gold hook on her bodice, and perched them
on Lady Eliza’s nose, sticking a pin in the wax
to hold them on. And at each ridiculous demonstration
the two aunts would become convulsed
with laughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t she lovely!” said Dolly, at last, as
she hung around Aunt Rachel’s neck, and
watched Dick tie the string of a red balloon to
Lady Eliza’s hand, just so that the balloon
kept thumping her in the face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is beautiful,” agreed Aunt Rachel, with
a shade of mental reservation in her tones.
“Where did you get her, and why did you take
my newest gown to play with?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t know it was your newest gown!”
said Dolly, regretfully; but Aunt Rachel told
her not to mind, they would take it off, and
there were several older ones that would do
equally well for Lady Eliza.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The story of the auction was told, and the
aunts had another season of mirth over the
ridiculous bidding.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” said Aunt Rachel, after the story
was finished, “but never bid on anything unless
you have enough money to pay for it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We didn’t,” said Dick; “we counted our
money first. And truly, this was the only thing
in the whole auction we wanted.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’m glad you have her. I think you
can have good fun with such a big doll. To-morrow
I’ll find you some clothes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aunt Rachel was as good as her word, and
next day she went to the attic and found several
discarded costumes of her own and Aunt Abbie’s
that were fine for Eliza. Hats and bonnets,
capes and shawls, a parasol and a feather boa,—indeed
the Lady Eliza soon had a complete and
even luxurious wardrobe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aunt Abbie touched up the injured cheek with
some water-colour paints, and then the injury
scarcely showed at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That afternoon the twins prepared to spring
the joke on Pinkie and Jack. They expected
them both to come over and play, and beforehand
they got the Lady Eliza ready. The arbour
in the playground was now nearly covered
with vines, and formed a well-shaded
tent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In here, at a table, they placed Eliza, her
hands meekly in her lap, and her face downcast.
She wore a black-and-white checked suit, and a
black hat and veil. Her hands were ungloved,
but were filled with flowers, which concealed the
artificial-looking finger-tips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Having arranged her exactly to their liking,
the twins sat on the veranda steps, waiting for
their friends. Pinkie came first, and Jack came
very soon after.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s go out to the playground,” said Dick,
casually.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” agreed Jack. “It’s too hot for
tag; let’s play hide and seek.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They all sauntered toward the playground,
and as they nearly reached it, Jack said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, there’s a lady in there!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A lady?” said Dick, looking surprised.
“What are you talking about?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is,” repeated Jack; “see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They all peeped through the vines, and sure
enough, a lady was seated at the table. Her
hands were full of flowers, but she appeared dejected,
and her head drooped a little.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It isn’t either of the aunties,” whispered
Dolly, “they’re in the house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who is it then?” Jack whispered back, and
Pinkie said, “Don’t let’s go in, I’m afraid.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Afraid of a lady!” said Dick. “Pooh, I’m
not. Maybe it’s your mother, Pinkie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, it isn’t,” she replied. “Mother’s at
home. Maybe it’s Hannah.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What would Hannah be here for?” said
Dolly. “Let’s go in and see who it is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” said Dick, and he stepped inside.
“She won’t speak to me,” he said, stepping
out again. “You go in, Jack.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not wishing to be thought cowardly, Jack
stepped into the arbour, and in his politest tones,
said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you do, ma’am?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the lady did not move, and just looked at
Jack with big blue eyes, that stared through her
black veil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s a funny lady,” said Jack, rather bewildered.
“She won’t speak, and she just stares
at me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You try, Pinkie,” said Dolly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Pinkie went up to the lady, and in her
sweet little voice <a id='said'></a>said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the matter, lady?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She, too, received only a blue-eyed stare, and
no word of reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps she’s asleep,” said Dick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, her eyes are wide open,” said Jack, his
own eyes also wide open in surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then she must have fainted,” said Dick;
“we must try to bring her to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He gave the lady a pat on the shoulder, but
still she didn’t stir.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hit her harder,” said Dolly. “Don’t hurt
her, you know, but you have to shake people to
make ’em come out of a faint.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dick thumped her on the back, and slily bent
her arm up until she seemed to be shaking her
fist at them. The flowers tumbled to the floor,
and her other arm flew up above her head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!” cried Pinkie, and ran farther away
from the now belligerent-looking lady.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!” cried Jack, catching on. Then,
screaming with laughter, he seized the lady’s
hand shook it, crying, “How do you do, ma’am!
How <span class='it'>do</span> you do? I’m <span class='it'>so</span> glad to meet you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pinkie was still mystified, so Dolly ushered
her up to the lady, saying, “Miss Pinkie Middleton
’low me to make you ’quainted with Lady
Eliza Dusenbury!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dick had taken off Eliza’s veil, and Pinkie at
last realised what sort of lady she was meeting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Dolly,” she cried, “where did you get
her? Isn’t it fun! I think she’s fine!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s great!” declared Jack. “You fooled
me good, old Mr. Dick Dana! What’s her
name, did you say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lady Eliza Dusenbury,” said Dick, “but
we call her Eliza, if we want to. Let’s take her
for a ride.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They got the little express wagon that Dick
and Dolly used to cart their plants or flower-pots
around the gardens in, and lifted Eliza in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’ll have to stand up,” said Dolly, “because
she can’t sit down.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” said Jack, “we’ll tie her so she
won’t upset.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They fastened her iron pedestal, which served
her instead of feet, firmly to the wagon, and then
proceeded to deck both vehicle and passenger
with flowers, till it looked like a float in a
parade.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly and Pinkie made a gilt paper crown,
and wound gilt paper around a long rod for a
sceptre.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, let’s make her Queen of the Fairies!”
cried Pinkie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the dress Eliza had on was changed for a
white one. This was decked with ribbons and
garlands of flowers. Crown and wand were put
in place, and then the whole four combined their
ingenuity to invent wings. At last they were cut
from thin pasteboard, and covered all over with
fringed white tissue paper. This fringe, about
an inch wide, and cut fine, was quickly made, and
when pasted on in close rows, gave a lovely
fluffy appearance to the wings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A gauzy white veil, spangled with gilt paper
stars, floated down from the crown, and the
Queen of the Fairies presented a most delectable
appearance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The express wagon was not good enough for
this dream of beauty, so it was made into a
float, by placing some boards on top of it. This
top was neatly covered with a sheet and decked
with flowers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the Queen of the Fairies was raised to
her triumphal car, and her four willing subjects
drew her about.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Long reins were made by cutting strips of
white muslin, and these were attached to four
prancing little steeds, while the Queen held the
ends in her waxen hands. The cortège made a
tour of the grounds, and drew up finally at the
house to exhibit their peerless Lady Eliza to the
aunties, who expressed heartfelt admiration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s the best plaything ever,” declared Jack,
as he and Pinkie went home. “We’ll be over to-morrow
to play some more.”</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'>“C</span>hildren,” said Aunt Rachel, one
afternoon, as dressed in their best calling
costumes, she and Aunt Abbie were
about to enter the carriage, “we are going to
make some calls, and about five o’clock I want
you to meet us at Mrs. Hampton’s, and we will
all come home together.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Auntie Rachel,” said Dolly, “I don’t
want to go calling to-day. I want to play.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know it, dearie, and so I’ve let you off
from most of the calls we’re making. But I
especially want you to be with me at Mrs.
Hampton’s, so you can play till half-past four,
and then get dressed and meet us there at five.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, Auntie,” said Dolly, who was
a sunny-tempered little girl, after all. “What
shall I wear?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Put on your new white piqué, and Dick,
wear your light-grey suit. Now, be sure, children,—be
there promptly by five.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes’m; and if you’re not there shall we wait
for you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Aunt Abbie, “wait until we come,
no matter what time it is. But we’ll be there
about five.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The aunts drove away and the twins played
out in the garden until it was time to dress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They started off, looking very demure with
their clean clothes and freshly-brushed hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t want to go a bit,” said Dolly, with
a little sigh, as she walked along.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Neither do I,” replied Dick, “but we have
to go, so there’s no use making a fuss about it.
Where does she live, anyway?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, I don’t know; I thought Auntie told
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, she didn’t, but I know it can’t be far, because
she said we could get there in ten minutes.
Here’s old Abe, let’s ask him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The twins stopped an old man who was going
by in his cart, and who was a well-known character
in the town.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hello, Abe,” said Dick. “Do you know
where Mrs. Hampton lives?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure, my boy. I just came from there,
havin’ been doin’ some cartin’ for her. You
see that red-brick house, over beyond those
trees?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it’s the next one beyond,—a white
one. You go over that way, and anybody’ll
direct you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right; thank you, Abe,” and the old
man drove on, while the twins followed the direction
he had given them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d like to skip,” said Dolly, “but it makes
our shoes all dusty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, we mustn’t do that,” agreed Dick.
“Aunt Rachel would have a cat-fit if we weren’t
spick and span when we get there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So they walked on sedately, only pausing now
and then to pick a flower, or look at a bird on a
branch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They inquired once more, in order to be sure,
and then turned in at Mrs. Hampton’s gate.
A fine fountain was playing in the front yard,
and the twins crossed the lawn to see if there
were any fish in it. There weren’t, but the plash
of the cool water was very attractive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll dare you to stick your foot in,” said
Dick, suddenly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They stood on the very brink of the fountain
basin, and so impossible was it for either twin
to refuse a “dare,” that Dolly’s immaculate
white shoe and stocking went flash into the
water and out again before she realised what
she had done.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Dick!” she exclaimed; “you made me
do that! What will Aunt Rachel say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Too bad, Dollums,” said Dick, greatly disturbed
at his own part in the mischief. “I
didn’t think what I was saying.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I didn’t think what I was doing! I
dare you to stick <span class='it'>your</span> foot in!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Partly because of the dare, and partly because
he was quite willing to share his sister’s fate,
Dick hastily thrust his own neat black shoe and
stocking in the water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There!” he said, as half proudly he drew
it out again. “Now we’re even!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; but how can we go into Mrs. Hampton’s
this way?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps they won’t notice. Mine doesn’t
feel very wet, does yours?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sopping! and they’ll drip all over her
carpet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s wipe them on the grass.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the green grass did not improve the appearance
of Dolly’s white shoe, though Dick’s
black one didn’t show the effects of the bath so
plainly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on, Dolly, we may as well face the
music.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They went on toward the house, and the dust
of the footpath settled on Dick’s wet shoe and
stocking until he was quite as untidy looking as
his sister.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wow! isn’t it soppy!” he exclaimed as the
water in his shoe oozed and spattered out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Horrid! I don’t see why we did it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, keep up a brave face, maybe the parlour
will be sort of dark and they won’t
notice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They rang the bell, and a maid opened the
door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is Mrs. Hampton in?” said Dolly, in her,
sweetest tones.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; walk in the drawing-room. What
names?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Dana and Mr. Dana,” said Dolly, and
was about to explain that they had come to meet
their aunts, when the maid disappeared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She returned to say that Mrs. Hampton
would appear presently, and for them to wait.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“’Course we’ll wait,” said Dick to Dolly, as
the maid again left them. “The aunties aren’t
here on time, after all. P’raps our feet’ll dry
before they come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish there was a fire. I’m dripping on this
pretty light carpet. Dick, let’s go out in the
kitchen or some place, and find a fire.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, come on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They left the drawing-room, and as they
crossed the hall they saw a bright wood fire
in a room across the hall, evidently the library.
So they went in, and drawing up two big chairs,
they sat down and held their two wet feet to the
crackling blaze.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is gay,” said Dick, leaning back in his
chair with a sigh of satisfaction. “We’ll be all
dry in a few minutes, Doll.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; but I wish Aunt Rachel would come
before Mrs. Hampton comes down. I don’t
know her. Do you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nope; never saw her. But the aunties are
bound to be here soon. It’s quarter-past five,
now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What <span class='it'>are</span> you children doing?” said a voice
behind them, and Dick and Dolly jumped from
their chairs, and saw a lady coming toward them.
She was a very pretty lady, in a trailing silk
house gown, and lots of frizzy light hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly thought she looked a little like Lady
Eliza, and not at all like any of Aunt Rachel’s
other friends.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you do?” said Dolly, making her
curtsey prettily, while Dick bobbed his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you do?” returned Mrs. Hampton,
“but who are you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re Dolly and Dick Dana,” said Dick,
“and our aunties said for us to meet them here
at five o’clock. But they don’t seem to be here
yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; they’re not. Are your aunties Miss
Rachel and Miss Abbie Dana?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes’m; and they said they would call here
this afternoon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And they told us if they weren’t here to
wait till they came,” said Dolly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes?” said Mrs. Hampton, looking at her
quizzically. “And why are you sitting almost
into the fire? It’s a warm day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Dolly, “but you see, we stepped
into the fountain as we came along, and so we’re
just drying our feet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s a very good idea,” and Mrs. Hampton’s
smiling eyes were as pleasant as if stepping
into fountains was quite usual for her guests.
“And so your aunts are coming to call on me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, at five o’clock. But they seem to be
late, so, if you please, we’ll wait for them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They waited until half-past five, and then
until quarter of six, and still the Dana ladies
didn’t come. The twins grew very impatient,
for it was most irksome to have to sit and talk
polite conversation with a grown-up lady.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Hampton asked so many questions too.
Very impertinent questions they seemed to Dick,
though he answered to the best of his ability.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Hampton was smiling and pleasant, and
seemed interested in hearing about the Dana
establishment, but still Dick and Dolly felt
uncomfortable, and wished their aunts would
come.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At six o’clock Mrs. Hampton said she felt
sure the aunts had changed their plans, and were
not coming, and she delicately hinted that she
would send the twins home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Dick, positively; “we must stay
here till they come. Aunt Abbie said to wait,
no matter what time it was. And, besides, if
they have changed their plans, and are not coming
here, they’d send Michael for us, anyway.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly agreed to this, and the two little martyrs
sat for another half-hour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, if you stay any longer, you must stay
to dinner,” said Mrs. Hampton at last. “Do
you sit up to dinner at home?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have supper at night,” said Dolly, and
her lip quivered a little, for she was beginning
to feel anxious about her aunts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I have dinner at night,—at eight
o’clock.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At eight o’clock!” exclaimed Dolly.
“Don’t you get awfully hungry before that
time?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I don’t,” said Mrs. Hampton, smiling;
“but I’m sure you chickabiddies will. So suppose
I give you a nice little supper up in my
sitting-room, and excuse you from dinner? I
have guests coming, and it isn’t exactly a children’s
party, you see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But we’re not going to stay here all night!”
exclaimed Dolly in dismay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It looks that way to me,” said Mrs. Hampton.
“I offered to send you home, and you
said no. Now I feel sure your aunts won’t
come,—it’s too late for them, and if you’re
bound to wait for them, I can offer you supper
and pleasant sleeping rooms,—but I can’t invite
you to dinner.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The twins were uncertain what to do. But
after all, they had no choice. Aunt Rachel had
told them to wait until she came, and Aunt
Rachel’s orders were always to be obeyed. To
be sure something might have happened to prevent
the aunties from carrying out their plan of
calling on Mrs. Hampton, but even so, they
would have sent for the children. And if they
had gone home, they would surely send Michael
over for them at once. It wasn’t as if the
aunties didn’t know where they were. They
had sent them to Mrs. Hampton’s, and told
them to wait there. So they waited.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They thought Mrs. Hampton seemed a little
annoyed because they waited. But as Dick said
to Dolly, “I’m not going to disobey Aunt Rachel
for another lady. But all the same, Dollums,
I do want to go home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So do I,” said Dolly, “I think it’s horrid
here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It wasn’t really horrid at all, but to be unwelcome
guests in a strange house is not especially
pleasant, no matter how pretty the house
may be.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The twins had been taken up to Mrs. Hampton’s
sitting-room, and in charge of a maid, had
been served with a delightful little supper.
Bread and milk, jam, fresh strawberries, and
dear little cakes, followed by ice cream, made a
goodly feast indeed. After it, their spirits rose
a little, and they ate their ice cream with smiling
faces.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think the aunties decided to come this
evening instead of afternoon,” said Dick, unable
to think of any other explanation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They never do make calls in the evening
but perhaps that’s it,” said Dolly, doubtfully.
“I hear people coming in, Dick, let’s go and
look over the banisters.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Carrying their ice cream plates with them the
twins stepped out into the hall and looked over
the banisters on the scene below.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a fascinating glow of lights and
flowers and ladies and gentlemen in evening
dress, for the dinner guests had come, and were
standing about, engaged in conversation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly was enchanted with the grand ladies,
with jewels in their hair, and with low-necked
gowns, and Dick, too, leaned over the banister
to see the gay scene. So absorbed were they
that they did not heed their melting ice cream,
and, almost at the same moment, the soft, cold
mass slid from each tipped-up plate, on the
heads and shoulders of the ladies and gentlemen
below.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such a shriek of dismay as arose brought Dick
and Dolly to a realisation of what they had
done, and in an agony of mortification they fled
back to the sitting-room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here Mrs. Hampton found them, their heads
buried in sofa pillows, and crying in muffled
paroxysms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must go home,” she said, and her cold,
hard tones were more of a reproof than any
words could have been. “My coachman will
take you, and I wish you to go at once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We wish to go, Mrs. Hampton,” said
Dolly, striving to choke back her tears while
she made some sort of apology. “We’re very
sorry we came, and we’re ’ceeding sorry we
spilled the ice cream. It was very good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This sounded as if Dolly merely regretted the
loss of the dainty, but it was not so. She
meant to compliment the supper that had been
given them, but, what with their worry over
Aunt Rachel’s absence, their own homesickness,
and the awful accident of the ice cream, both
children were completely upset.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please forgive us,” said Dick, holding out
his little hand. “We’ve had a lovely time,—and,—and
we hope you’ll come to see us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t make you out!” said Mrs. Hampton,
looking at the children in perplexity. “I
thought you threw down that ice cream purposely.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no!” cried both twins at once, and
Dolly went on eagerly: “you see, we never saw
low-necked ladies and gentlemen at a party before;
and we were so awfully interested, we
leaned over to see better, and I s’pose the gas-lights
heated up our ice cream and melted it,
and it just slipped off the plates.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We ought to have held the plates more
level,” said Dick, thoughtfully; “I’m sorry we
didn’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sorry, too, for you mortified me terribly
and annoyed my guests, which was worse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s terrible!” said Dolly, with a sigh. “I
don’t see how you <span class='it'>can</span> forgive us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I couldn’t if you weren’t such a sweet little
culprit,” said Mrs. Hampton, smiling, and
catching Dolly in her arms and kissing her.
Then she kissed Dick too, and, still smiling,
she hurried away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The maid found the children’s hats, and hurried
them down the back stairs, where the coachman
was waiting for them. Evidently the servants
were not as forgiving as Mrs. Hampton,
for Dick and Dolly were fairly hustled into the
carriage, the door was banged shut, and they
were rapidly driven homeward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At Dana Dene, they were met on the threshold
by two very frightened-looking ladies, and
while Aunt Rachel and Aunt Abbie each clasped
a twin in her arms, the Hampton carriage drove
away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You <span class='it'>dear</span> babies! where have you been?”
cried Aunt Abbie, while Aunt Rachel squeezed
Dick with an affection too deep for words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where have we been?” cried Dick, in
amazement. “Why, we’ve been at Mrs. Hampton’s,
where you told us to go, and wait for
you. We’ve been waiting there ever since five
o’clock!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Dickie, dear,” expostulated Miss
Rachel, “we went to Mrs. Hampton’s at five
o’clock, and waited there for you until nearly
six! Then we came home, and ever since we’ve
been nearly frantic because we didn’t know
where you were. Michael and Pat have been
out hunting with lanterns.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, Auntie, dear,” said Dolly, “we <span class='it'>did</span> go
to Mrs. Hampton’s, and after we waited and
waited, and you didn’t come, she gave us supper
in her sitting-room, ’cause she had a dinner
party in the dining-room, and the ladies had
on beautiful frocks, all lacy and low-necked,
and we spilled ice cream on ’em!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes’m; we didn’t mean to, you know, but
it melted.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dolly, what <span class='it'>are</span> you talking about? Mrs.
Hampton is not having a dinner party this evening.
I just left there at six o’clock, so I know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, <span class='it'>our</span> Mrs. Hampton is,” said Dick.
“Are there two Mrs. Hamptons in Heatherton,
auntie?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, of course there aren’t! I wonder
where you <span class='it'>have</span> been!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, she <span class='it'>is</span> Mrs. Hampton, we called her
that, and so did the maid. It’s a beautiful
house,—with a great big open round in the hall,
where you can look down,—and a fountain
outside.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Rachel sent for Michael.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Michael,” said she, “where do you suppose
these children have been? Whose carriage
brought them home?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know, Miss Rachel. It’s a new
turnout in Heatherton. All swell, jingly harness
and livery, an’ the like o’ that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dolly says they live in a big white house
with a fountain in front.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Arrah, thin, it’s the new people as is afther
takin’ the Van Zandt place. A widdy lady of
great forchin, I’m towld; an’ be the same token,
I do belave they said her name was Hampden,
or somethin’ like that.”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='177' id='Page_177'></span><h1>CHAPTER XIII</h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;font-size:1em;'>AUNT NINE</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'>O</span>f course that was the explanation. Mrs.
Hampden was a wealthy young widow
who had just came to Heatherton to
live. The Dana ladies did not know her, and
probably never would have known her had it
not been for the twins’ escapade.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For lively little Mrs. Hampden belonged to
a gay, modern set that had little in common
with the Dana ladies’ older and more conservative
circle of friends. Also, she was not at all
like the Mrs. Hampton on whom Miss Rachel
and Miss Abbie were calling, and where the
twins were expected to meet them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But as the real fault lay at the aunties’ door,
inasmuch as they had not given the twins sufficiently
explicit directions, it did not seem fair
to blame Dick and Dolly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And after hearing the story the twins told,
Miss Rachel and Miss Abbie saw that it was
their duty to call on Mrs. Hampden, and apologise
for the trouble the children had made for
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was not a pleasant or an easy thing to
do, but as it turned out, Mrs. Hampden was so
flattered at having the Dana ladies call on her
that she willingly forgave the children’s escapade,
and begged that they might be allowed
to come to see her again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was not promised, for Miss Rachel Dana
of Dana Dene was very careful about making
new acquaintances, and considered her present
visiting list quite long enough. The children
themselves had no wish to go again to the house
where they had met with such an untoward
accident, and so the incident was closed, and the
aunts trusted that Mrs. Hampden would not
return their call.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I do think,” said Aunt Abbie, as they
discussed the matter at home, “that you two
children ought to be reproved for spilling that
ice cream.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think so, too,” said Dick, cheerfully, “but
’course you know, auntie, that we didn’t mean
to do it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly,” said Aunt Abbie, with some
asperity, “I don’t suppose you poured it down
on the people purposely. But you are quite old
enough to know better than to walk about with
saucers of food in your hands.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So we are!” said Dolly, as if surprised at
the fact. “Aunt Abbie, I do believe we’re
’ceedingly bad children!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not exactly that,” said Aunt Abbie, smiling
in spite of herself, “but you are exceedingly
thoughtless, and I want you to strive to correct
that fault.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes’m,” said Dick, earnestly, “we’ll strive
like fury. Honest, we will, Aunt Abbie.
Won’t we, Doll?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, indeedy!” agreed Dolly, with a very
affirmative wagging of her head. “And now,
if you’re all through scolding, Aunt Abbie, may
we kiss you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, without waiting for the requested permission,
both children tumbled themselves upon
Miss Abbie, and gave her the soft answer that
turneth away wrath. For who could continue
to reprove two affectionate small persons, whose
chubby arms flew about in wild caresses, and
whose insistent kisses fell just wherever they
happened to land? But Miss Abbie Dana was
determined to instil some sense of decorum into
her young charges, so when released from their
embraces, she began again:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now that’s another thing, children; I want
you to love me, of course. But it seems to me
you needn’t be so—so——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rampageous?” volunteered Dick. “That’s
what Pat says we are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We can’t help it, auntie,” said Dolly, fixing
her big brown eyes solemnly on her aunt. “You
see, we’re so ’thusiastic that when we love anybody
we love ’em fearful! And we just ’dore
you and Aunt Rachel. Don’t we, Dick?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I guess!” and then Miss Abbie had
to stand another series of pats and kisses, which,
in view of the recent conversation, the twins
made a little less boisterous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you’re dear little twinsies,” said Aunt
Abbie, as at last they ran away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And,” she added to herself, “I think I
can make them improve their manners by just
keeping at it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Poor Miss Abbie wanted to bring the children
up rightly, but the work was so new to her she
didn’t know exactly how to conduct it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As for Miss Rachel, she vibrated between
over-indulgence and over-severity, an occasion
of one being conscientiously followed by the
other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the twins nearly always had their own
sweet way, and as, though sometimes thoughtless,
they were not mischievous children, Dana
Dene was brighter and happier for their presence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One Monday the aunties were getting ready
for the Reading Circle, which was to meet at
Dana Dene in the afternoon. It was very inconvenient
for all the members that the club
should meet on washdays, but as it always had
done so, of course that couldn’t be changed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some ladies had the washing put off till Tuesday,
but life at Dana Dene was far too methodical
for that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So when the club was expected, Delia tried
to get her wash all hung out by noon, and so
be ready to help in the afternoon. For, though
the club didn’t assemble until three o’clock, and
tea was served at five, there was much to be
done in the way of prinking up the house for
the occasion. The twins were allowed to help,
and Dolly dusted, and brought water for the
flower vases, and helped adjust fresh pillow-shams
and bureau covers, until Aunt Rachel
declared she didn’t know how she ever got
ready for Reading Circle without Dolly’s help.
And Dick’s as well; for he cut flowers, and ran <a id='lots'></a>lots
of errands, and did lots of useful things.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And when, at about eleven o’clock, he saw
the telegram boy coming with a yellow envelope,
he took it and flew to Aunt Rachel with it faster
than any one else could have done.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For gracious goodness’ sake!” exclaimed
Miss Rachel as she read it; “Aunt Nine is
coming to dinner to-day!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To-day!” said Miss Abbie in a tone positively
tragic, as she sank down in a big chair.
“Why, she can’t, Rachel! It’s after eleven
now, and the Reading Circle coming at three,
and nothing but cold beef for dinner!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It doesn’t matter whether she can or not;
she’s coming,” and Miss Rachel, who had turned
fairly white with dismay, sat down opposite her
sister.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who’s Aunt Nine? What a funny name!”
cried Dick, dancing around in excited curiosity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly picked up the telegram, which had fluttered
to the floor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“‘Will arrive at twelve-thirty,’” she read;
“‘meet me at the station.’”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, it’s signed ‘P. Dana,’” said Dick.
“How can P. Dana be Aunt Nine? How can
it, Aunt Abbie?” He squeezed into the big
chair beside Miss Abbie, and patted her cheek
to attract her attention. “How can it? How
does P. stand for Nine? Or do you mean nine
aunts are coming? Oh, Doll, wouldn’t that be
fun?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me,” urged Dolly, squeezing herself
into Aunt Rachel’s lap, “tell me first, auntie,
’fore Dick knows. Quick, tell me! Who’s
Aunt Nine? What does it mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Dolly, for mercy’s sake don’t bother
me now! She’s Aunt Penninah, your great-aunt,
of course. We always call her Aunt Nine.
And she’s the most particular, fussy, pernicketty
old lady in the world!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, she’s dreadful!” sighed Aunt Abbie.
“We always spend weeks getting ready for her.
She never came so unexpectedly before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But the house is all in order,” suggested
Dolly, anxious to be comforting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, for the Reading Circle. But not for
Aunt Penninah. She looks into every cupboard
and storeroom, and, besides, we’ve nothing for
dinner.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll go get something,” offered Dick.
“What do you want?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I don’t know! I don’t know!” groaned
Miss Rachel. “Go and send Hannah here.
And it’s wash-day, too! And the Reading Club!
Oh, what can we do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But after the first surprise and bewilderment
were over, the Dana ladies rose to the occasion,
and did the best they could.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Michael was sent to town for supplies, Hannah
was instructed to set the table with special
elaboration, and Aunt Abbie herself went into
the kitchen and whisked up a pudding.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Delia was still at her washing, and Pat was
putting finishing touches to the lawn and flower-beds
so they could not be disturbed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The twins flew about in earnest endeavours to
help, but after their breaking a cut-glass vase,
and upsetting a small table of bric-à-brac, Aunt
Rachel lost patience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dick and Dolly,” she said, “you go upstairs
and stay either in your own rooms or in your
playroom until dinner is served at one o’clock!
Do you understand? No; I’m not scolding, but
I’m so put about that you two simply drive me
distracted! Now obey me exactly, for that’s
all you can do to help. Come down to the
library at five minutes to one,—not a minute
before. And see that you’re spandy clean,
and very nicely dressed. Put on your blue
lawn, Dolly, and tie your hair ribbons carefully.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes’m; Dick’ll tie ’em for me. He does
it just lovely.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Subdued by Aunt Rachel’s desperate manner,
the twins crept away, resolved to be very good,
and do exactly as they were told.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It isn’t twelve yet,” said Dick; “no use
dressing now. We’d only get all rumpled up.
Let’s go up in the playroom.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So up they went, and began to play with
Lady Eliza.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hello, ’Liza!” cried Dick, shaking her
wax hand cordially. “I haven’t seen you in
some time. Are you well?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pretty well,” said Dolly in a squeaky voice.
It was part of their play that, whenever either
twin spoke to Lady Eliza, the other twin was to
answer for her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pretty well. But I’m tired of this old
frock,—I want a change.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” said Dick; “we’ll fix you up.
Let’s rig her up gay, Doll, and we’ll show her
off to Aunt Nine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” and Dolly flew to the trunk that
contained Lady Eliza’s wardrobe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They selected an old-fashioned blue silk dress
that Aunt Rachel had given them, and proceeded
to array Eliza in it. Then Dolly dressed her
hair. She loved to do this, for Eliza’s hair
was very profuse, if not of very fine texture,
and soon Dolly had built a fine array of puffs
and curls, with a fancy ornament of blue and
silver tucked in at the side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, desiring to make her very grand, Dolly
put a necklace of her own round Eliza’s neck,
and added several long strings of beads, hung
with various trinkets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do I look?” said Dolly in the squeaky
voice that always represented Lady Eliza’s talking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You look gay,” said Dick. “Perhaps this
afternoon you’ll meet a grand lady, Miss Nine
Dana. I hope you’ll behave properly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I’ll behave lovely,” squeaked Eliza, and
then the twins ran away to dress for dinner.
By quarter of one they were all ready.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly looked very sweet and demure in her
frilly blue lawn, and her beautiful hair was tied
with a big white bow which Dick had skilfully
arranged. By practice his deft little fingers had
conquered the science of tying bows, so Dolly’s
hair ribbons were always marvels of correct
proportions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had promised not to go to the library
until five minutes of one, and the ten minutes
intervening seemed interminable. They drifted
back to the playroom to say good-by to Eliza,
when Dick had an inspiration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s take her down,” he said, “and put
her in the dining-room to greet Aunt Nine when
we all go out to dinner.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s!” cried Dolly, and in a jiffy they
were carrying the Lady Eliza Dusenbury silently
down the back stairs. By good luck they didn’t
encounter Hannah or the aunties, and they
reached the dining-room in safety.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where shall we stand her?” said Dick.
“In the bay window?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Dolly. “Let’s sit her at the table.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She won’t sit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, we’ll sort of slide her under; if we
put her in Aunt Rachel’s big chair she’ll be all
right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They propped Eliza into the chair, and though
she seemed to be falling backward in a swoon,
her bright eyes and pink cheeks betokened good
health. Her elaborate costume looked fine at
the prettily set table, and Dick moved her arms
about until they seemed extended in welcome.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s fine!” said Dolly, nodding admiringly
at the tableau.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is finer!” cried Dick, and taking the
large carving-knife from the table, he thrust it
into Eliza’s outstretched hand. This was easily
done by sticking the knife handle partly up her
long tight sleeve, and her effect, as she brandished
the glittering steel, was now ferocious.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gay!” cried Dolly; “won’t they be s’prised!
Come on, Dick, it’s five minutes to one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The twins, hand in hand, went into the
library, and with their best curtseys were presented
to Aunt Penninah.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“These are the children, Aunt Nine,” said
Miss Rachel, and Dick and Dolly saw, sitting
an a big armchair, the most imposing-looking
personage they had ever met.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Penninah Dana was a large and very
tall woman, with white hair, and large, piercing
black eyes that seemed to see everything.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“H’m; twins, are you?” she said, looking at
them over her eyeglasses. “You seem very demure.
Are you always so quiet?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dick rolled his eyes toward Aunt Rachel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall we show her?” he whispered, quite
ready to pounce on the new aunt if desired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mercy, no!” said Miss Rachel. “Do behave,
if you can.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said Dick, answering Aunt Nine’s
question, “we’re <span class='it'>not</span> always so quiet. But to-day
we’re trying to be good because you’re
here, and the Reading Circle is coming.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But sometimes we’re good when there isn’t
company, too,” put in Dolly, not wanting to be
misjudged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m surprised at that!” said Aunt Nine,
but there was a merry gleam in her eye, and
somehow the twins began to think they were
going to like her in spite of her majestic appearance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then dinner was announced, and, as the guest
arose, the children were impressed afresh with
her evident importance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She walked like a duchess, and seemed to expect
everybody to dance attendance upon her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aunt Rachel picked up her handkerchief, and
Aunt Abbie her vinaigrette, for she dropped
them both as she rose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The twins, greatly interested, walked behind,
and they all started toward the dining-room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they neared the door, the hostesses stepped
back and Aunt Penninah stalked stiffly into the
room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps it was not to be wondered at, for
the figure at the table was certainly startling to
look at, and the glittering carving knife was
aimed straight at her, but Aunt Penninah threw
up both her hands, gave a fearful shriek, and
fainted dead away!</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='191' id='Page_191'></span><h1>CHAPTER XIV</h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;font-size:1em;'>A CORONATION</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'>“O</span>h, Aunt Nine, what <span class='it'>is</span> the matter?”
cried Miss Rachel, bending over her,
while Miss Abbie fluttered around distractedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had not yet seen Lady Eliza, as they
were so engrossed with their stricken guest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nor did it occur to Dick and Dolly, at first,
that it was their beloved Eliza that had caused
the trouble.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aunt Penninah began to revive, as Miss
Rachel sprinkled water in her face, and Miss
Abbie held her strong smelling-salts to her
nose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who is it?” she asked, faintly, sitting up
on the floor, and pointing to the dangerous-looking
person with the carving knife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” cried Dolly, “if she wasn’t scared at
Lady Eliza! Why, that’s nobody, Aunt Nine!
Only just a wax doll.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take that thing away!” said Miss Rachel,
sternly, as she realised what had happened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dick and Dolly fairly jumped. Aunt Rachel
had never spoken to them in that tone before,
and they suddenly realised that it had been
naughty to put Eliza at the table, though they
had thought it only a joke. Silently, the twins
began to lift Eliza from her chair, when Aunt
Nine screamed out:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come away, children! You’ll be killed!
Oh, Rachel, who is she?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nobody, Aunt Nine. It’s a doll, a wax
dummy that belongs to the children. They put
her there for fun, I suppose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fun!” roared Aunt Penninah, glaring at
the twins. “Do you call it <span class='it'>fun</span> to frighten me
out of my senses?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As her speech and manner nearly frightened
the twins out of <span class='it'>their</span> senses, they were pretty
nearly even, but apparently the old lady was
waiting for an answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We <span class='it'>thought</span> it would be fun,” said Dolly,
truthfully. “You see, we didn’t know how
easily you scared.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Easily scared, indeed! Who wouldn’t be
scared to come into a room and find a strange
woman brandishing a carving knife in my very
face! A nice pair of children you are! Leave
the room at once,—or else I shall!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dick and Dolly were bewildered by this
tornado of wrath, and began to edge toward
the hall door, keeping out of reach of the irate
lady.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Miss Rachel, though deeply mortified and
seriously annoyed at the twins’ mischief, was a
strong stickler for justice, and she well knew,
Dick and Dolly had meant only a harmless
joke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, Aunt Nine,” she said; “don’t take
this so seriously. The children meant no harm,
they wanted to amuse you; and had it not been
for the carving knife, I daresay you would have
found the Lady Eliza very funny indeed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Funny! that horrible thing with her staring
eyes! Take her away so I can eat my dinner!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At a gesture from Aunt Abbie, Hannah and
Dick removed the offending Eliza, and returned
the carving knife to the sideboard. As Eliza
was a great friend of both Hannah and Delia,
she was allowed to stand in the butler’s pantry
all through dinner time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, what do you say, Aunt Nine?” said
Aunt Abbie, “may the twins sit at table, or
would you rather have them sent from the
room?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, let them stay,” said the old lady, not
very graciously. “I’ve no desire to be too
severe, but that awful sight shocked my nerves,
and I may never get over it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This awful outlook grieved Dolly’s tender
heart, and she flew to the old lady and clasped
her hand, while she said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m <span class='it'>so</span> sorry, Aunt Nine! I didn’t know
you had nerves, and I thought you’d be ’mused
to see Lady Eliza sitting there. I don’t know
<span class='it'>how</span> we happened to give her the carving knife.
But we ’most always put <span class='it'>something</span> in her hand.
I wish we’d thought of a fan! That would
have been pretty, and it wouldn’t have hurt your
nervousness,—would it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps not,” said Aunt Penninah, grimly,
but she couldn’t help smiling at pretty little
Dolly, who was caressing her be-ringed old
hand, and looking imploringly up into her face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then she turned to Dick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And how about you, sir?” she said. “Did
you think it amusing to threaten a guest with
a carving-knife?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dick came over and looked at her with his
straightforward eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t mean to threaten you, of course,”
he said. “But it <span class='it'>was</span> naughty, and I’m sorry,—we’re
both sorry,—and can we do <span class='it'>anything</span>
to make you forgive us?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, you can’t,” said Aunt Penninah, “but
when you look at me like that,—with your
father’s very eyes,—there is no question of forgiveness.
You’re all Dana—both of you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then the strange old lady kissed both
the twins and peace was restored all around.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dinner went on smoothly. Miss Abbie and
Miss Rachel were secretly impatient, because
there was much yet to be done before the Reading
Circle came, but Miss Penninah’s presence
admitted of no scanting of ceremony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hannah’s service was more punctilious than
the twins had ever before known it, for Hannah
had been at Dana Dene many years, and knew
the exactions and demands of a visit from Miss
Penninah.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But at last the lengthy meal reached its close.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you go to your room for a rest, Aunt
Nine?” said Miss Abbie, hopefully, as they rose
from the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I won’t; I’m not tired at all. I’ll
make the further acquaintance of these very
astonishing young relatives of mine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, do, Aunt Nine! Do come and play
with us!” cried Dick, with such unmistakable
sincerity that the old lady was greatly pleased.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, come out and see our gardens,” said
Dolly, dancing by her side, and to the great
relief of the other two aunties, Miss Penninah
walked off with the twins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Hannah and the two ladies flew ’round
like mad. They put leaves in the table until it
was as long as possible; they set it with all the
best china and glass and silver for the Reading
Circle’s tea. For the feast was not a tea at
all, but a most elaborate supper, and Aunt Nine’s
coming had sadly delayed the preparations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meantime, that elderly dame was walking
round the children’s playground. She was
greatly pleased with their gardens, and was surprised
to learn that they tilled and weeded
them all themselves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re really very smart little people,” she
said, “and quite worthy to bear the Dana
name.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The twins were flattered, for they well knew
how highly all their aunts thought of the Dana
name, and, too, they had already begun to like
the peculiar old lady who had scolded them so
harshly at the very beginning of their acquaintance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When it was nearly time for the ladies of the
Reading Circle to arrive, Aunt Rachel told the
twins they must go out to their playground and
stay there all the afternoon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For,” she said, “I cannot run the risk of
having some ridiculous thing happen during our
programme. You don’t mean to do wrong, but
you’re just as likely as not to stand Lady Eliza
up beside our President when she’s making her
address. So take Eliza with you, and go out
to the garden, and stay there until Delia rings
the bell, or Hannah comes to call you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” said Dick, “and if any of the
boys or girls come over, may Hannah send them
out there to us?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I’ll tell her. Now, run along.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They ran along, though slowly, because of
Lady Eliza’s difficult <a id='trans'></a>transportation. But at
last they reached the playground, and stood
Eliza in a corner, ready for action when they
needed her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jiminy Crickets!” remarked Dick, “but
Aunt Nine’s the funny old lady, isn’t she,
Doll?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yep; but I sort of like her. After she got
through blowing us up, she was real jolly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, and wasn’t Auntie Rachel the brick to
stand up for us at dinner time?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She was so. I wonder how long Aunt Nine
is going to stay.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I dunno. A week, I guess. Hello, here
comes Pinkie. Hello, Pinkie!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hello!” she returned, and then almost before
she and Dolly had said “Hello!” Jack
Fuller came.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This quartette were almost always together
on pleasant afternoons, and as Dana Dene had
attractions that the other homes didn’t possess,
they played there oftener than elsewhere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hello, Lady Eliza Dusenbury,” said Jack,
shaking hands with that silent partner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of course, all the boys and girls knew Lady
Eliza now, and indeed the citizens of the village
had ceased to be surprised when the twins rode
to town in the farm wagon, with Eliza accompanying
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The servants at Dana Dene took her as a
matter of course, and Michael was fond of
bowing politely, and saying, “The top of the
mornin’ to ye, ma’am!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s build a throne and crown Eliza
queen,” suggested Jack, and the rest at once
agreed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What shall we make the throne of?” asked
Dolly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll ask Michael,” said Dick, “he always
helps us out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Michael was busy with some extra work
connected with the visit of the Reading
Circle, and had no time for bothering with
youngsters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Throne, is it?” he said; “I’ve no time to
be buildin’ ye royal palaces! Take the wheelbarry
fer a throne, shure!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a chance suggestion, but it served, and
Dick returned to the waiting group, trundling
the wheelbarrow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We can’t bother Michael much,” he said,
“’cause he has to run that Reading Circle thing.
But I guess we can fix up this wheelbarrow with
flowers and greens and make it do. Hello,
Maddy; Hello, Cliff!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madeleine and Clifford Lester had arrived
during Dick’s absence, but greetings were soon
spoken, and the more the merrier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the half dozen went to work with a
will, using both heads and hands to devise ingenious
plans for the coronation of Eliza.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She ought to be dressed in white,” said
Dolly, looking disapprovingly on Eliza’s blue
dress; “but she hasn’t a white frock to her
name.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hasn’t your aunt any?” asked Pinkie, realising
the real need of white.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t bother her to-day,” said Dolly, decidedly;
“she’s got the Reading Circle and Aunt
Nine both at once; and she told me to keep
out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Couldn’t you get a big white apron from
Delia,” suggested Maddy Lester.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; queens don’t wear aprons.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Dolly’s eye lighted on the clothes line,
full of the Monday wash, which busy Delia had
not yet taken in, though it was thoroughly dry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I might get something there!” she cried.
“Come on, girls!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The three girls ran to the big, sunny bleaching
ground, where three long lines of white
clothes waved in the breeze.</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='partyA'></a></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re all too little,” said Pinkie, as she
viewed Dolly’s own dresses and petticoats.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, here’s Aunt Rachel’s nightgown! This
will do!” cried Dolly, and in a jiffy she had
the clothespins pulled off, and the voluminous,
ruffled garment in her arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just the thing!” cried Maddy, and they
raced back to the playground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It made a beautiful white robe for Eliza,
and when belted with a large bath-towel, also
brought from the clothes line, Eliza looked
like an Oriental princess.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get another towel and make a turban,”
said Clifford, and this gave their queen a still
more foreign look.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The throne thing ought to be white, too,”
said Pinkie, who had an eye for color effect.
“It’ll be a lot prettier to pin the flowers and
greens on, if it’s white first. Let’s get sheets,—shall
we, Dolly?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t care,” said Dolly, absorbed in
making Eliza’s turban stay on her head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Pinkie and Madeleine flew for the sheets,
and stripped the clothesline of all there were
there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now!” they exclaimed, coming back triumphantly,
with their arms full of billows of
white linen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now!” cried Dick, and they fell to work,
and draped and twisted the sheets, until the
wheelbarrow was a lovely white throne. This
they decked with their flower garlands, and then
lifted Queen Eliza up on it. As she, too, had
been decked with blossoms and garlands, it was
really a pretty sight, and the children clapped
their hands and danced about in glee at their
own success.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, we’ll crown her,” said Dick, “but I
say, Dollums, we all ought to be in white,
too!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s easy,” said Dolly, recklessly;
“there’s lots of things on the clothesline yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Back there they all ran, and chose costumes
to please their varying tastes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The three girls chose more ruffled nightgowns
like Eliza’s and looped them up with flowers
on either side, like fancy overskirts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boys selected lace-ruffled petticoats that
belonged variously to the aunts or to Hannah
and Delia, and round their shoulders they
draped tablecloths or pillowshams in toga
fashion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some table centrepieces and carving-scarfs
formed fine head-gear, and by the time all the
costumes were completed, the clotheslines
looked as if the wash had been taken in after
all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The white-garbed half dozen pranced back
to the queen on her throne, and the ceremonies
began.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“First, we sing a dirge,” said Jack Fuller.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not a dirge,” said Dolly. “Don’t you
mean a chant?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, some waily kind of a thing, anyway.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So they all droned an inharmonious series of
wailings that might have been imitative of
Chinese tom-toms, only it wasn’t meant to be.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now we must have a speech,” said Pinkie;
“you make it, Dick; you’re good at that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” said Dick, and stepping forward,
while his tablecloth toga trailed in the dust, he
began:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Queen Eliza Dusenbury, we beg you to
accept this crown. We want you for our beloved
queen, and we will obey all your rules
and reggilations. We bow our hominage——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Homage,” corrected Jack.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“’Taint, it’s hominage! bow, anyway!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So they all bowed in token of homage to their
queen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now we have to back away,” said Maddy;
“they always do at court.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The six backed away from the queen’s throne,
but as backing with long trailing robes is not
to be neatly done without practice, they one and
all tripped over their trains and togas and went
tumbling around on the ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get up, all of you!” cried Dick, who had
scrambled to his feet. “Now we must sing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What shall we sing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t care—‘John Brown’s Body,’ I
guess.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So they all sang “John Brown’s Body” with
great gusto, and then the coronation ceremonies
were declared over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And none too soon, for just then they saw
Michael coming with a huge trayful of good
things, which he placed on the table in the
arbour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fer the land’s sake!” he exclaimed as the
children crowded round. “Whativer have yez
been up to now! The clean clo’es from the
line, as I’m a sinner! Arrah, but ye’ll catch it,
ye bad babies!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wow! they did get dirty, didn’t they?”
exclaimed Jack, realising for the first time how
they had tumbled about on the ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, they’re all dirt and grass stains. Will
your aunts mind, Dolly?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know,” said Dolly, “but anyway
it isn’t your fault, any of you. Let’s take ’em
off and eat supper now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was characteristic of Dolly to spare her
guests’ feelings, though she had herself a sudden
uneasy sense of naughtiness at having taken
the clean clothes to play with. But it was also
her nature to put off an evil hour, if possible, so
the children gaily scrambled out of their white
raiment and sat down to the feast with good
appetites.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The girls is waitin’ on the Readin’ ladies,”
said Michael, as he came out with a second trayful,
“so ye’re to wait on yerselves with these
things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Dolly and Pinkie arranged the table,
and soon the group were eating sandwiches and
cakes and strawberries and ice cream, and all
the good things that went to make up a Reading
Circle feast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The little raskills!” said Michael, as he
gathered up the sheets and garments they had
thrown off. “Whativer is the rayson, I dunno,
but Miss Dolly and Masther Dick is just the
baddest little shpalpeens I iver saw, an’ yet I
love ’em, ivery breath they draws!”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='207' id='Page_207'></span><h1>CHAPTER XV</h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;font-size:1em;'>PUNISHMENT</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'>T</span>he Reading ladies had departed, and
the younger guests of Dana Dene had
also trotted homeward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s too bad to take those things off of
Eliza,” said Dolly, “she looks so pretty in ’em.
Let’s take her, wheelbarrow and all, to show to
the aunties.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m ’fraid Aunt Nine will faint again,”
objected Dick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no, she won’t; it was the carving knife
that scared her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the twins trundled the white-draped wheelbarrow,
and its white-garbed occupant straight
up to the front door of the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come out, aunties!” they called. “The
queen wants you to salute her majesty!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hearing the commotion, the three ladies came
out on the veranda, and this time Aunt Penninah
did not faint, but seemed greatly interested in
the majestic Eliza.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What have you put on her?” the old lady
cried. “Why, they’re clothes,—rough-dry!
Did you take them from the clotheslines?
Rachel, do you allow these children to act up
like that? I am ashamed of them, and you,
too!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just then Delia came out to the veranda with
a clothes-basketful of the garments the children
had played with. Good-natured Delia rarely
minded the twins’ mischief, but it had been a
specially hard day, and the extra work and company
had tired her out completely. Also, it
<span class='it'>was</span> annoying to find her carefully washed
clothes all muddied and grass-stained!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will ye look at this, Miss Rachel!” she
exclaimed, her face red and angry. “It’s too
much to ask of a gur-rl to hurry up her wash
an’ cook for comp’ny on a Monday, an’ thin
to go fer her clothes, an’ find ’em like this!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aunt Rachel and Aunt Abbie looked at the
twins. So did Aunt Penninah. Dick and
Dolly looked at the clothes in Delia’s basket.
They <span class='it'>were</span> a sorry sight, but the twins seemed
surprised rather than ashamed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Delia Maloney!” cried Dick. “Are
you sure we spoiled those clothes like that!
Why, we just wore them to the coronation. I
didn’t ’spect it would hurt ’em a bit!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Neither did I!” cried Dolly. “I’m awful
sorry, Delia. I s’pose we ought not to have
taken ’em; but truly, I never thought about their
getting dirty. Will you have to wash ’em all
over again?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will I!” said Delia, grimly; “that I will,
Miss Dolly; an’ a foine time I’ll have <a id='get'></a>gettin’
the green stains out, for-bye the mud; an’ to
say nothin’ of their being torn to bits!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She held up a sheet and a tablecloth, each of
which showed a jagged tear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll mend those,” said Dolly, cheerfully,
“they’ll be good practice, for Aunt Rachel is
just teaching me darning in my sewing lessons.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soft-hearted Delia couldn’t help smiling at
the earnest little face; Aunt Rachel and Aunt
Abbie looked perplexed; but Aunt Penninah
was unable to restrain expression of her feelings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re the worst children I ever saw!”
she exclaimed; “the very worst! At nine
years old you should know better than to cut up
such naughty, wicked tricks! You must be
severely punished. Rachel, if you don’t punish
them, I shall do so myself!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now Dick and Dolly were quite unaccustomed
to this sort of scolding. Aunt Rachel,
though severe in principle, was very lenient in
practice, and Aunt Abbie was gentleness itself.
So it was with real curiosity that the twins drew
nearer, to look at the reddening face and flashing
black eyes of their great-aunt, and Dick said,
very seriously:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We <span class='it'>were</span> naughty, Aunt Nine; and if you
punish us, how are you going to do it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The question was not at all impertinent,
Dick’s round little face showed only a justifiable
interest, and Aunt Penninah looked a little
baffled, as both twins waited eagerly for her
answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do just what you please in the matter, Aunt
Nine,” said Miss Rachel, who had never quite
outlived her youthful awe of the stern old lady.
Miss Abbie clasped her hands in alarm, as if
fearing the twins would be subjected to torture,
and they all awaited Miss Penninah’s dictum.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think,” said the old lady, slowly,—and
then she paused, a little disconcerted at the
earnest gaze of the four brown eyes, that were
so like those of the children’s father, her favourite
nephew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think,” she went on, more gently, “that
I shall forbid you to go outside the house all
day to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She didn’t say that she had had a far more
severe punishment in mind, but had been deterred
from inflicting it by those appealing
eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whew!” cried Dick, “stay in the house a
whole day!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Aunt Nine, her ire returning as
she noted the other aunts’ sorrowful looks, and
Delia’s woe-begone face. “You children need
discipline. It’s terrible the way you’re let to
run wild! Rachel, you’ve no idea of training
children properly, and as for you, Abbie, you’re
simply a tool in their hands!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly took a step nearer to the old lady.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aunt Nine!” she cried, with flashing eyes,
“don’t you talk like that about my Aunt Abbie,
or my Aunt Rachel, either! They know how
to bring up children just splendid! And they’re
doing the best they can with me and Dick, but,
as you know yourself, we’re the worst children
ever,—so what can you ’spect?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Dick, taking his sister’s part,
as usual. “We’ll do your old punishment, and
we’re sorry we were naughty;—but you can’t
jump on our aunties like that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The youngest inheritors of the celebrated
Dana “spunk,” faced bravely the oldest member
of the proud old family, and she realised the
justice of their reproof.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The children are partly right,” she said,
turning to her older nieces with a short, sharp
laugh; “and the matter must not be discussed
further in their presence. Dick and Dolly, you
will obey my orders about to-morrow, and now
come and kiss me, and we will drop the
subject.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dick stared at his aunt and hesitated, but
quicker-witted Dolly appreciated that, in Aunt
Penninah’s mind, the coming punishment wiped
out even remembrance of the fault, and she
willingly kissed her. Not the spontaneous, loving
sort of embraces they gave the other
aunties, but a whole-hearted, honest kiss of
truce.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dick followed her example, and then the
twins were excused, and they raced out in the
kitchen after Delia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The intherferin’ ould lady!” cried Delia,
as she snatched the children in her arms.
“Sorra the day I iver wint to Miss Rachel wid
thim clo’es; but I was that put about, Miss
Dolly, dear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, pooh, Delia,” cried Dick; “you were
all right, and we’ve come to ’pollergize for
spoilin’ your wash all up. We’re awful
sorry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” chimed in Dolly, as Delia embraced
them both; “we’ll never do it again; but, truly,
Delia, we didn’t think!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Av coorse ye didn’t, ye blissid babies!
Shure ye niver think! An’ what’s a wash, more
or less? I wish ould Miss Penninah had to do
it hersilf fur teasin’ ye.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, Delia,” said Dick, “you mustn’t talk
that way. Aunt Nine is our aunt, and we must
love and respect her just as we do the other
aunties.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a thrue Dana ye are, Masther Dick;
both of yez. An’ ye’re right, too. Miss Penninah
is the grand old lady, and the rale head
of the fambly. So do yez take yer punishment
like the shwate childher ye be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And having duly made good their reputation
as “true Danas” Dick and Dolly trotted off
to bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next day proved to be the very loveliest
day of the whole Spring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sun incessantly winked an invitation for
the twins to come out and play. The blue sky
smiled the same plea, and the soft breeze whispered
it again and again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The flowers nodded at them as they looked
out of the windows, and the trees spread their
branches, as in a welcoming embrace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The birds twittered, “Come, come!” and,
though too far away to be heard, Dolly knew,
her pet chicken was peeping the same words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But worst of all was to see Pat watering
their own flower-beds,—their pansies and daffodils
that had never drank from any hands save
the twins’ own!</p>

<p class='pindent'>This sight nearly made the tears come, but
Dick said bravely:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We must make the best of it, Dollums.
There’s no use of getting all weepy-waily when
it won’t do any good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, but Dick, don’t you s’pose she’d just
let us go and water our plants,—if we came
right back?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sha’n’t ask her; and don’t you ask that,
either. Now we’ll both do our practising,—I
guess I’ll practise another hour while you’re
doing your old sewing,—and then let’s go up
in the attic to play.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly brightened a little. “All right; we’ve
always been going to fish around up there, and
we never had a good chance before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Dolly went to one piano, and Dick to the
other, and they practised so diligently and painstakingly,
that Aunt Penninah, who listened at
the doors, was greatly pleased with their thorough
work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s good stuff in those children,
Rachel,” she said; “if you don’t spoil them by
your foolish leniency and over-indulgence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t mean to, Aunt Nine,” said Miss
Rachel, a little meekly, “but you know they’re
never purposely mischievous. The Danas are
all impulsive and thoughtless, and Dick is exactly
like his father was at his age.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I know all that; but they need a strong
hand to rule them, and though you and Abbie
are firm enough in some ways, you give right
in to those twins. Now, I don’t!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Miss Rachel, grimly, “you
don’t. How long are you going to stay this
time, Aunt Nine?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I planned to stay only a day or two; but as
I’ve become interested in John’s children,
I shall remain a week at least. I want to learn
their natures, and, incidentally, I can help you
with my judgment and advice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Rachel groaned in spirit, but made no
audible objection to her aunt’s decree.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly’s sewing hour that day was devoted to
mending the clothes she and her little friends
had torn, and by dint of much instruction from
the three aunts, and honest industry on her own
part, she achieved some very creditable darns
and patches.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the sewing hour, Aunt Penninah
sought out Dick, and had a talk with him.
She was rather severe, but the clan feeling was
strong in both, and after their conversation
Dick felt a loyalty and respect toward the old
lady, if not a deep affection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, Dolly’s sewing hour being over, the
twins scampered for the attic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s horrid,” said Dick, “to be shut up in
this stuffy old place on a day like this; but let’s
get all the fun we can out of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s,” agreed Dolly, and as a starter they
rambled through the old, unused rooms, and
looked at the old pictures and discarded furniture
stored there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Awful poky!” said Dick as they sat down
on a haircloth sofa, and stared at each other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Dolly, with a scowl. “I think
Aunt Nine is a horrid——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t talk that way, Doll,” said Dick, remembering
his conversation with the old lady;
“just forget it,—forget outdoors and flowers
and everything,—and let’s play something nice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What can we play?” asked Dolly, disconsolately.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I dunno; but isn’t it funny why we can’t
think of something? If it was a rainy day and
we couldn’t go outdoors, we’d have lots of fun
in the house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, let’s play it’s raining then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was a distinct suggestion, and Dick
caught it at once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wow!” he cried, looking out of the window;
“what a storm! It’s just pouring!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So it is!” said Dolly, gleefully; “we
couldn’t go out to-day even with umbrellas!
Do you s’pose it’ll clear by to-morrow?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I guess so. But it won’t stop all day
to-day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I don’t believe it will. So we’ll play
up here to-day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the twins went into the big lumber
room, where all sorts of old things were stored
away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s that big boxy thing, face to the
wall?” asked Dolly, looking at a plain black
walnut affair, about as high as herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dunno; let’s turn it around.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dick pulled the thing out from the wall,
which was quite easy, as it rolled on casters,
and it proved to be entirely open on the other
side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was about four feet high, and about three
feet wide, and though something like a small
wardrobe, it was divided into six equal compartments,
each of which was lined with wallpaper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Dick!” cried Dolly, “it’s a playhouse!
A doll’s house, you know. I believe
it was Aunt Abbie’s when she was a little
girl. Do you s’pose there’s any furniture for
it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Must be; somewheres. Isn’t it gay? See
the windows, they have real glass in ’em. This
must be the kitchen with oilcloth on the floor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; and the other floors are all bare. I
s’pose the carpets are put away somewhere, with
the furniture. Let’s hunt them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The twins were not long in discovering three
or four good-sized boxes tied together, which
proved to contain the furniture of the doll’s
house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, what fun!” cried Dolly, as they took
out little beds and tables and chairs. “But
we can’t put these in place till we find the carpets.
Oh, here comes Aunt Rachel. Auntie,
was this your babyhouse when you were a little
girl?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Aunt Rachel, coming toward the
twins. “I meant to fix it up for you some day,
Dolly, but perhaps you’ll like to fix it yourselves
just as well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, we will, Auntie!” cried Dolly, tumbling
into her aunt’s arms for a few caresses before
they looked for the carpets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who made the house, Auntie?” said Dick,
snuggling into her other arm, and patting her
cheek.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, a carpenter, I suppose. Father had it
made for me when I was ten years old, and your
father was a toddling baby. He used to creep
up to it, and pull out the things that he could
reach.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did he look like us?” asked Dolly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He looked like Dick. You both have eyes
like his, but his hair was in dark ringlets all
over his head, like Dick’s is. Now, let’s find
the carpets, and fix up the house. Wouldn’t you
rather have it down in the playroom?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes,” said Dick. “It’s pretty hot and
dry up here. The playroom is lovely and airy,
’most like outdoors.” He gave a little sigh, and
Aunt Rachel remembered that the children were
undergoing punishment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her eyes twinkled a little, as she said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aunt Nine didn’t make any other stipulation,
except that you were to stay in the house all
day, did she?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No’m,” said Dick. “And, Auntie Rachel,
we’re <span class='it'>awful</span> sorry we spoiled the clean clothes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, <span class='it'>terrible</span> sorry,” added Dolly, while
they both fondled their aunt half-unconsciously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can be the sorriest pair of twins I ever
saw, after your mischief is accomplished,” said
Miss Rachel. “Why doesn’t your sorriness begin
beforehand, I’d like to know?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you see,” said Dolly, “we don’t
think——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s just it, you never ‘think.’ Now,
I’m going to teach you to think,—somehow; I
don’t know how yet, but we’ll manage to make
you thinkers somehow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“After Aunt Nine goes away,” suggested
Dick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” agreed Aunt Rachel, “after Aunt
Nine goes away.”</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;font-size:1em;'>THE PLAYHOUSE</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'>T</span>hen they all went down to dinner, the
twins holding hands with each other,
round Aunt Rachel’s ample waist. As
she had an arm round each of their necks, locomotion
down the stairways was difficult, but
they all accomplished it somehow, and made a
triumphal entry at the dining-room door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aunt Penninah was already in her chair, and
looked up sharply, as if expecting to see a doleful
pair of twins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the laughing faces proved that, if not
enjoying their punishment, the children were,
at least, making the best of it, and Aunt Nine
sniffed a little, as she asked:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What have you been doing all morning?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, having the beautifullest time!” exclaimed
Dolly. “We found an old doll’s house,
that used to be Auntie Rachel’s when she was a
little girl.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And my father played with it, too,” said
Dick, proudly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Rachel,” said Miss Abbie, with a disappointed
look, “we meant to keep that for
their Christmas!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It doesn’t matter,” said her sister, serenely;
“they may as well have it now. Hannah, tell
Michael to bring it down to the playroom while
we’re at dinner.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hannah obeyed, and the twins could scarcely
eat their dinner for anticipation of the fun to
come.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your punishment doesn’t seem very hard to
bear,” said Aunt Nine, looking quizzically at the
children.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes it is, Auntie,” said Dick. “We’d
ever so much rather run out of doors in this
sunshiny day, and save the playhouse for a rainy
day. Truly, we feel the punishment very much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It somehow seemed to Dick’s queer little brain
that it was rude to defraud Aunt Penninah of
her rights. She had evidently expected them to
repine at being kept indoors, and though they
hadn’t exactly done that, she was entitled to
know that they really were feeling the punishment.
And it was quite true. Both he and
Dolly would have gladly postponed the playhouse
fun, to scamper out for a run in the garden.
Aunt Nine nodded a sort of approval.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re an honest little chap, Dick,” she
said; “I’m beginning to like you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you like Dolly, too?” asked Dick,
with the air of one merely seeking information.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I like you both. If you’d be a little
more thoughtful, and——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, we’re going to learn to think,” said
Dolly. “Auntie Rachel is going to teach us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish her joy of her task,” said Aunt Penninah,
but her eyes twinkled just a little mite, and
the twins began to think she was really not such
an ogress as she had seemed at first.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After dinner they all went up to the playroom,
and found the playhouse well placed, in a corner
between two windows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” cried Dolly in rapture, as she saw
the boxes full of furniture, and the bundles of
carpet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The carpets smelled of camphor as Aunt
Rachel unrolled them, for they had been carefully
put away from the moths, and proved to be
in perfect condition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The aunties all looked a bit sober, as the
small squares were unfolded, for their thoughts
flew back nearly forty years, when Rachel and
Abbie had been little girls, and Penninah Dana
had been a beautiful young woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But no such memories saddened the twins’
hearts, and they capered about in glee, shaking
out the carpets, and holding them up for inspection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is the parlour one!” cried Dolly, as a
light velvety square appeared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She tucked it into place, and it exactly fitted
the parlour floor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two bedroom carpets were there; a library
and a dining-room,—and the kitchen already had
oilcloth on it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then came the furniture, and both twins
fairly squealed with delight over the funny little
things, as they took them from the boxes and put
them in place in the rooms of the playhouse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dining-room furniture was all of iron.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That stove,” said Miss Rachel, holding a
black iron stove of the shape known as “cylinder,”
“father brought me when I was getting
well after the measles. ‘You can build a real
fire in it,’ he said, ‘it’s a real little stove.’”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And did you?” asked Dick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; several times. There’s a tiny tin pipe
that goes out through this hole in the wall of the
house. See?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The twins saw, but there was so much to see,
little time could be spent on any one thing. The
parlour furniture was of satin brocade, of deep
red colour, which was unfaded, and quite as
good as new.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I helped make those chairs,” said Aunt
Nine. “I cut and basted, while your mother
sewed them, Rachel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re beautifully made,” said Miss Rachel.
“Dolly, if you want some more, you can
make them in your sewing-hour.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll make you some,” said Aunt Penninah.
“If you can find some pretty bits of stuff, Abbie,
I’ll make a few to-day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, do, Aunt Nine,” cried Dolly. “These
chairs are all right, but it would be so lovely
to have some new ones of our very own!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m going to make some little wooden chairs
and tables,” said Dick. “I can cut them out
with my jigsaw, and glue them together.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do,” said Aunt Abbie, “and we’ll make
satin cushions for them, and tie them on with
little ribbons.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The furnishing of the house went on, and it
would be hard to say which were more interested,
the twins or the older people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When they came up to the bedrooms, they
found the tiny sheets and pillowcases yellow
with age.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you make us some new ones, Aunt
Rachel?” asked Dolly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; or Delia can bleach these for you.
They’re as good as ever, except their colour.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the aunties discovered that the portières
for the parlour were faded, and the lace curtains
had turned irretrievably brown, so off went Aunt
Abbie to get some bits of stuff at once, to make
new ones.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And very soon the three aunties were busily
engaged in cutting and sewing all sorts of pretty
things for the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The best bedstead was of the sort that requires
dimity curtains and valance to make it
complete.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aunt Penninah offered to fit this bed out entirely,
and her deft needle flew in and out of
the muslins Aunt Abbie brought, until she had
made the little bed the most charming affair
imaginable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In addition to the curtains, she hemmed tiny
sheets; she made a dear blanket, of a morsel of
white flannel bound with ribbon; and lovely
pillowcases, with hemstitched ends.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, to Dolly’s breathless delight, she made
a little silk comfortable, with a layer of cotton-wool
in it, and tacked at intervals with microscopic
bows of blue ribbon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of course this work of the aunties took all
the afternoon, and indeed, it wasn’t finished that
day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the interest in the house grew more and
more absorbing as the days went by, and though
the children loved out of doors best, they often
devoted a few hours of the pleasantest days to
“Dana Cottage,” as they called it. When it
was nearly finished, as to furnishing, they
began to prepare a family of dolls to occupy it.
Aunt Nine offered to present the entire
family, and afterward assist in making their
clothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So one fine afternoon Miss Penninah and the
twins drove to town to select the dolls. It was
great fun, and yet it was a responsibility, too.
Dick was quite as much interested as Dolly, for
somehow, the house offered so much boyish
work, and play, that it didn’t seem like “playing
with dolls.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Besides the twins always did the same things,
and Dolly would have lost her own interest in
the playhouse if Dick hadn’t shared it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So, after much consultation, they chose a father
and a mother doll, an aunt doll, two small
children dolls, and a baby doll. A nurse and
two other servants were added, and then they
declared they had enough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Enough? I should think so!” said Aunt
Nine, who began to see endless doll-dressing
ahead of her. But her eyes twinkled; and then
she let the twins select from the shop several
bits of dolls’ furniture that were not in
vogue when the playhouse was originally
furnished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Laden with their treasures they all went home,
and that very evening the aunties began on the
dolls’ wardrobes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is this your idea of disciplining the children,
Aunt Nine?” said Miss Rachel, as they
sewed, after Dick and Dolly had gone to bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Penninah Dana looked a little confused,
but she answered straightforwardly:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think you were nearer right than I, Rachel.
The twins are not what we used to call ‘good
children.’ I mean the meek, mild, priggish little
persons that children were taught to be when I
was young. Dick and Dolly are so full of life
and spirits that they do wrong things from
sheer thoughtlessness and gaiety of heart. But
they are never wilfully mischievous, and never
deceitful about it afterward. They do need
firm guidance, but they do not need to be
taught the difference between right and wrong,
for they already know it. They are true
Danas.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Miss Penninah announced that last
fact, she felt that she had given the last word
of praise to the twins, and indeed, the other two
aunts thought so too.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So clannish were they, and so proud of their
fine old family, that they greatly preferred Dick
and Dolly to be “true Danas” than to possess
many other admirable traits. And so, the three
stitched away, quite agreed, at last, on the management
of the children, and hoping they would
grow up to manhood and womanhood, with the
inherited traits of dignity, honour, and refinement
that characterised their family.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile the “true Danas” upstairs were
sleeping soundly, and only awoke when the sun
peeped in at their windows and winked and
blinked right into their eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And when, later, they danced down to breakfast,
there in a row on the sofa sat a smiling and
well-dressed family, all ready to take up their
abode in “Dana Cottage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly went into ecstasies over the mother doll,
who wore a trailing house dress of light blue
satin trimmed with lace. The aunt, too, was
resplendent in crimson velvet, and the children
were in the daintiest of white or light frocks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The father-doll had been difficult to dress,
but though a professional tailor might have
taken exception to the cut, the aunties had made
his neat suit fit him very well indeed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dick was interested in the new family, and
admired them duly, but he was already thinking
of how he could build a yard around the
house itself, and he confided his plans to
Dolly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll fence off a space all round the house,”
he said. “I’ll make a little picket fence with
splints. It’s just as e-easy! Then we’ll get
green velvet carpet for the grass.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, carpet isn’t a bit like grass,” objected
Dolly. “It’s so thick and dusty. Let’s have
real dirt,—or sand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think sand is messy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, so do I. Oh, I tell you what, Dick!
Let’s cut green tissue paper into fine fringe, and
put it round where we want grass,—paste it to
something, you know,—like we made fairies’
wings,—only green.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, that’s the ticket!” exclaimed Dick.
“Then we’ll make little paths of,—of brown
paper, I guess,—pasted down.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; take a big sheet of pasteboard first, and
then stick everything on it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, that’s what I mean. Then bits of evergreen
for trees, and perhaps real flowers, growing
in little bits of pots.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it will be lovely! Dick, you’re splendid
to think of it all!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The twins joined hands and jumped up and
down, as was their custom when greatly pleased
with each other. Then the aunties came in, and
they all went to breakfast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The children told their plan for the yard
around the house, and the ladies agreed that
it would be lovely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll help you to make a pond, Dickie,” said
Aunt Penninah, “like one I had when <span class='it'>I</span> was a
little girl. That dates farther back than Aunt
Rachel’s childhood.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you make a pond?” asked Dick,
not much interested in comparative dates of past
Danas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We must get a piece of mirror,—without a
frame, you know,—and put it in the middle of
your grass plot, and then put pretty stones or
shells round the edge of the mirror, and it looks
just like water.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And little tin ducks on it,” shouted Dick,
“like a real pond! Oh, Auntie, that will be
tip-top!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I’ll make you a pond on the other side
of your house,” put in Aunt Abbie, “of real
water. In a big flat pan, you know; and little
sprigs of fern all round the edge.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right; we’ll have both,” declared Dick.
“I don’t know which’ll be nicest, they’re both
so splendid. And I’ll make a little boat to sail
on the water. I can whittle it out of a stick.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I’ll make a sail for it.” said Aunt
Abbie, “and we’ll rig up a sail-boat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such interest did the aunts take in the cottage
yard, it was almost as if they were children too,
and Dick and Dolly became more and more enraptured
with the wonderful things they made.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aunt Abbie fashioned a little hammock with
her crochet needle and some green and white
cord. When she put fringe along its edges, and
suspended it from two evergreen trees in the
“yard,” Dolly thought she had never seen anything
so cunning. Two little dolls were put
into it, and the nurse doll was set to swing them
until they fell asleep. Michael, who was
greatly pleased with the whole affair, fashioned
a tiny arbour just like their own in their playground
outside. It was made of tiny twigs,
and when the gardener brought it in, as his
offering to the general gaiety, it was accepted
with hilarious thanks. Very small green vines
were twisted about it, and tiny blossoms of
forget-me-not or lilies-of-the-valley were entwined.
But the little flowerets faded so soon
that Aunt Abbie made some diminutive roses
of pink tissue paper, which would stay fresh all
summer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Many plans were made for future additional
beauties, and the little estate grew rapidly to an
elaborate country place, when Michael declared
that he should build a barn for it. This announcement
was heralded with delight, and for
many days, Michael spent all his spare time in
the tool-house, Dick and Dolly bobbing about
him, and helping or hindering as best they could.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The barn, when done, was a grand affair
indeed. Not of very elaborate architecture, but
provided with stables, carriage house, feed bins,
and even a chicken coop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again Aunt Nine took the twins to town on a
shopping expedition, and this time they returned
with all the four-legged and two-legged toys
necessary to complete the barn’s use and beauty.
Also there were carriages for the dolls to drive
in, and sleighs, too, for in doll land the lack of
snow makes no difference in the sleighing season.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aunt Penninah’s visit of a week lengthened
out to a fortnight, but not until the last tiny
carriage robe was finished, and the last hat and
cape made for the smallest doll, did Aunt Nine
make her farewells to Dana Dene.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, then, she went away, promising to return
for another visit as soon as possible, and insisting
on a promise that the twins should some
day visit her in her own home.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'>P</span>inkie was enraptured at her first sight
of Dana Cottage. She sat down in
front of it and gazed in silence, seemingly
unable to take it all in at once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” she said at last, “it’s a lovely home
for dolls, but wouldn’t it be a fine place for
fairies?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly laughed, for she hadn’t the firm belief
in fairies that Pinkie had. Dolls were good
enough for her, and as Pinkie loved dolls too,
they spent many happy hours with the playhouse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sometimes Dick and Jack played with them,
and sometimes the boys went off on their own
sports, while the girls were absorbed in the dolls’
house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One afternoon the boys were busily engaged
in making and flying kites, and the girls, up in
the playroom, were having lots of fun with
Dana Cottage, but paused in their play frequently,
to run and look out of the window to
see how the kites were flying.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t believe they’ll ever make them go,”
said Pinkie, as she and Dolly leaned out of
the playroom window. “The kites are too
big.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then they’ll have to trim ’em off, or make
smaller ones,” said Dolly, philosophically. “I
don’t see any fun in kite-flying anyway, just because
they ’most never do fly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wouldn’t it be funny,” said Pinkie, “if you
could fly a kite, ’way—’way up in the air, and
then pull it down again, and find a whole lot
of fairies perched on it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; that would be fine. But fairies don’t
live up in the air.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; they live in the woods, hidden by the
ferns and leaves. I wish I could ever see them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you can’t, ’cause they only come out
at night. You can’t go to the woods at night,
can you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will, when I’m grown up. ’Course,
mother won’t let me now, but when I’m big,
the first thing I’m going to do is to go to the
woods, and camp out all night, and watch for
fairies.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right; I’ll go with you. We’ll surely
see them then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, indeed, we will. Oh, I wish we could
go now!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, we can’t. Aunt Rachel wouldn’t let
me, and I know your mother wouldn’t let you.
Come on, those kites will never fly; let’s go on
with the party.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The doll family in Dana Cottage were giving
a very grand party. As there were no other
dolls to invite, Pinkie and Dolly had made a lot
of paper dolls for the guests. These were not
elaborate, being hastily cut from brown paper,
but they wanted a lot of guests, so they chopped
out a multitude of dolls, and stood them around
in the various rooms of the doll house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish we’d made them prettier,” said
Dolly, regretfully, for her artistic sense was
jarred upon by the crude brown paper guests
in the dainty, pretty rooms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So do I,” agreed Pinkie. “Let’s dress
them up a little, somehow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So they found colored tissue paper, and bedecked
the dolls with floating sashes and scarfs
and head-dresses, until they presented a much
more festive appearance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s lots better,” declared Dolly, as they
placed the improved ladies and gentlemen at
the party. So many did they have, that the
parlour was filled with dancers, and the
dining-room with supper guests at the same
time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pinkie was of a realistic turn of mind, and
insisted on having bits of real cracker or cake
or apple in the dishes on the table, and real
water in the pitchers and coffee pots on the sideboard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly was quite content to have scraps of
paper for cakes, or even empty dishes filled
merely with imagination, but when Pinkie played
with her they usually had real things wherever
possible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The china dolls of the family, and the paper
guests kept up a continuous conversation, and
the voices were either Pinkie’s or Dolly’s as occasion
required. A deep, gruff voice represented
a gentleman talking, and a high, squeaky voice,
a lady.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a beautiful party we’re having,” said
a brown paper man in Dolly’s deepest chest
tones.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” squeaked a lovely lady, in light blue
crinkled tissue paper. “Please get me a glass
of lemonade.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The brown gentleman deftly poured about
two drops of water from a tiny pitcher into a
tinier cup, and gallantly offered it to the lady.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It accidentally soaked her tissue paper scarf,
as she drank it, but two drops wouldn’t hurt
anybody’s costume seriously, so the incident was
overlooked, and the gay chatter went on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you going to opera to-morrow night?”
asked one bewitching belle of another.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes,” was the reply. “I’m so fond of
music. I practise an hour every day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So do I. I’m learning to sing, too. That’s
why I wear this boa, I have to take such care
of my throat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you warm enough here?” inquired the
china hostess, who overheard her paper guests’
conversation; “because, if you aren’t, we can
light a fire for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do feel a little chilly,” began the paper
belle, and then Pinkie’s voice suddenly resumed
its natural tones:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Dolly, let’s make a fire in the little
stove,—a <span class='it'>real</span> fire. You said your aunt used to
do it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, she did,” said Dolly. “Do you know
how?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, yes; you only put in snips of paper
and light ’em. The smoke goes out through
the pipe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Carefully, the girls put crumpled bits of paper
into the little iron stove, and then Dolly brought
a match.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You light it,” she said, and Pinkie struck
the match, and touched off the paper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They shut the tiny stove door, and the paper
blazed away merrily. Some smoke came out
through the tin pipe, but there wasn’t much of
it, and as the windows of the playroom were
all wide open, the smoke soon drifted away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was a great game indeed, and the guests
from the parlour all crowded down into the
dining-room to get warm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was much laughing and chatter, as the
paper dolls came down to the dining-room, and
packed themselves in groups against the walls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, how good that fire feels,” exclaimed a
lady in pink paper. “Why, it’s all gone out!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was astonishing how fast the paper in the
stove burned itself out, and the girls had to
renew it repeatedly, and light it afresh each time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m ’bout tired of playing this,” said
Pinkie; “let’s make one more fire and that’ll
be the last. It’s getting awful hot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, make one more,” said Dolly, “for
Mrs. Obbercrombie has just come down to get
warm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right; stand her up by the stove.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pinkie touched off the newly-laid fire, and
Dolly stood paper Mrs. Obbercrombie up near
the stove; so near, in fact, that the lady fell over
against it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly reached out to pick her up, but her
finger touched the hot stove, and she drew it
back with an “Ouch!” The little stove, from
the burning of much paper, was nearly red-hot,
and when the paper doll fell over against it, she
blazed up immediately.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the paper dolls nearest her caught fire
at once, and in two seconds the paper dolls were
all ablaze. The tissue paper scarfs communicated
the flames like tinder; the thicker paper
of the dolls themselves burned steadily, and in
a few moments the curtains caught, then the
wooden house itself, and as the breeze from the
open windows fanned it, a real conflagration
of Dana Cottage ensued!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon the paper grass in the cottage yard
caught fire, and the wooden animals served as
further fuel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly, her smarting finger still in her mouth,
was too frightened even to scream, but Pinkie
showed real presence of mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She grasped a pitcher of water from the
table, and dashed it into the burning house.
This was good as far as it went, but it merely
checked the flames in one room, and there was
no more water about. Then Pinkie seized the
big rug from the floor, with intent to throw it
over the house. But it was so anchored with
heavy tables and other furniture that, of course,
she could not budge it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!” she gasped at last. “Do something,
Dolly! Yell, can’t you? I don’t seem to have
any voice!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sure enough, poor little Pinkie was so frightened
that her voice had failed her, and Dolly
was so frightened, she couldn’t <span class='it'>think</span> what to do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So, at Pinkie’s suggestion, she yelled, and
Dolly’s yell was that of a young, sound pair of
lungs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Auntie!” she screamed. “Michael!”
But as the playroom was on the third floor, and
the aunts were down in the library, they did not
hear her. Nor were the servants within ear-shot,
so poor Dolly screamed in vain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But as the flames grew bigger and threatened
the window curtains of the playroom, Dolly
shouted again, and this time a wild, despairing
shriek of “Dick!” seemed to be her last resort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, by chance, the boys, with their kites,
were not far from the house, and they heard the
cry ring out of the playroom window.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hello, Dolly!” shouted Dick, back again,
not thinking of danger, but merely supposing
Dolly was calling to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His voice reached Dolly’s ears like a promise
of hope, and flying to the window, where the
curtains were already scorching, she screamed,
“Fire, Dick! Call Michael! Pat! Bring
water! Fire! Fire!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even as Dolly shouted, Dick and Jack saw
the flames, and Dick cried out, “I’ll go for
Michael; you go upstairs, Jack, and screech for
Aunt Rachel as you go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the two Dana ladies were startled from
their quiet reading, by seeing Jack Fuller dash
madly in at the front door, and whipping off
his cap by instinct, almost pause, as he said
politely, but hastily, “Please, Miss Rachel,—good-afternoon.
Your house is on fire! Excuse
me!” and he ran breathlessly by the library
door and up the stairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He couldn’t do a thing when he reached the
playroom, for the flames were beyond the efforts
of a ten-year-old boy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Dolly, who had found her wits, cried,
“Pull down the curtains,” and she and Jack
bravely pulled down a pair of light muslin
curtains that had already begun to burn. They
stamped on these, and so extinguished their
flames, and Pinkie, in her excitement, pulled
down another pair and stamped on them, although
they had not caught fire at all, and,
indeed, were in no danger of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But by that time, Michael and Pat had
arrived. Passing the trembling aunties on the
lower landing, they tore upstairs, and Dick followed
closely at their heels.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Michael took in the situation at one glance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take holt av the table,” he said to Pat,
and the two strong men hustled the big table off
the rug. Then they flung aside the chairs and
other furniture that held the rug down, and,
picking up the big carpet, flung it over the burning
playhouse. The house toppled over with a
crash, and the men trampled on the whole
pile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They smashed everything belonging to Dana
Cottage, but it was the only way to conquer the
flames, and Michael did not hesitate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Keep it up!” he said to Pat, and as Pat
obediently stamped his big feet about, Michael
turned to other parts of the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stepped on a few smouldering papers, he
pinched out a tiny flame in a curtain ruffle, and
he threw a small rug over an already blazing
waste-basket.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He unceremoniously pushed aside any children
who got in his way, for Michael was very
much in earnest. And he had reason to be.
His prompt and speedy action had probably
saved the whole house from burning down, and
after he was sure there was no lurking flame
left anywhere, he turned to the two ladies, who
stood white-faced and trembling on the threshold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, Miss Rachel,” he said, cheerily;
“the baby-house is done for, but we’ve saved
Dana Dene from burnin’ up intirely.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is everybody safe?” asked Miss Rachel,
bewildered with the suddenness and terror of
it all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Safe an’ sound, ma’am. Now, don’t dishturb
yersilves further, but you an’ Miss Abbie
an’ the childher go back downstairs, an’ me an’
Pat’ll be afther cleanin’ up some here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But Dolly is burned!” cried Miss Abbie,
seeing Dolly still holding out her blistered
finger, and screwing her face in pain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Dolly, “I did that before the
fire. It’s nothing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s an awful blister,” said Dick, looking at
it. “But how did the fire start, Dollums?
Did you do it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Dolly, “but I didn’t mean to
burn up the cottage.” And then, as Michael and
Pat were removing the big rug, and she saw the
dreadful devastation of the beautiful dolls’
house, she burst into paroxysms of weeping.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pinkie did the same, and as the aunts were
both softly crying, too, Dick and Jack had to
be very careful lest they join the majority.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go downstairs, all of yez,” said Michael,
again, who had, by reason of his common sense,
assumed dictatorship. “Oh, are ye there, Hannah?
Take the ladies down, and mend up Miss
Dolly’s finger. Boys, ye can shtay, if ye like,
but the rest of yez must go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Obediently, the aunties followed Hannah,
who led the weeping Dolly, and with Pinkie
trailing along behind, they went downstairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, boys,” said Michael, “ye can help
if ye like, an’ ye needn’t, if ye don’t like. Pat
an’ me, we’ll clear out this burnt shtuff, but
Mashter Dick, suppose ye look about now, an’
see if anny of the toys is worth savin’.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Dick and Jack picked out some few things
that the flames hadn’t destroyed. But only
china or metal toys escaped utter destruction,
and these were so smoked and charred, that they
weren’t much good. Pinkie’s hat and jacket
were scorched, but Jack laid them aside, and
the work of salvage went on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There now, ye’d betther go,” said Michael;
“ye’re good boys, an’ ye’ve helped a lot, but
now, me’n Pat, we’ll cart this shtuff down oursilves.
An’ be the same token, I’m thinkin’
we’ll dump it out the windy,—that bein’ the
quickest way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Dick and Jack ran downstairs, really
anxious to join the girls and find out how it all
came about.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;font-size:1em;'>A LOVELY PLAN</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'>W</span>hen the boys reached the group
assembled in the library, Dolly
had just begun to tell the story
of the fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Up to that time, the aunts had been employed
in dressing the burned finger, and in recovering
their own mental poise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see,” Dolly was saying, “it was an
accident, Aunt Rachel, but it <span class='it'>wasn’t</span> mischief,
for you told me yourself how you used to make
a fire in that little stove.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” said Aunt Rachel, comprehending at
last. “Did you girls make a fire in the playhouse
stove?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes’m; the pipe was up, you know, and it
burned all right,—it hardly smoked at all.
Then one of the paper dolls fell against it and
set fire to all the rest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The stove got so awful hot,” observed
Pinkie, “and it was trying to pick up that paper
doll that Dolly burned her finger.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And upset the stove?” asked Aunt Abbie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Auntie, the stove didn’t upset. But
Mrs. Obbercrombie caught ablaze, and then she
fell over against the other paper people, and
they all flared up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whew, Dolly!” exclaimed Dick. “Then
you kindled that whole fire yourself! You
ought to have known better than to stuff a place
with paper dolls and then set a match to it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I didn’t, Dick,” declared Dolly. “The
fire was all right at first, only it kept making
the little stove hotter and hotter, until it went
off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it’s lucky Dick heard you yell,” put
in Jack, “or the whole of the big house would
have burned as well as the little one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know what to say to you, Dolly,”
said Aunt Rachel. “I remember that I did
tell you I used to have a fire in that stove, but
I only burned a tiny bit of paper and let it go
right out. I never thought of a continued fire.
And I really think you ought to have realised
the danger of a fire near so much light paper.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, I never once thought of that, Aunt
Rachel. I never s’posed fire could jump through
an iron stove, and burn up a paper doll! I
thought if we kept the little door shut, the
flames would stay inside.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Dolly,” said Aunt Abbie, smiling a
little in spite of herself, “you should have
known better. But you’re not entirely to blame.
We did tell you that we used to have real fire
in that stove, but father was always with us to
look after it. Children should <span class='it'>never</span> play with
fire alone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why didn’t you tell me that before, Aunt
Abbie?” said Dolly, looking at her with a gentle
reproach in her big dark eyes. “If you had,
I’d have called you up, ’fore we lit it the first
time!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Phyllis,” said Miss Rachel, turning to the
little guest, “does your mother let you play
with fire.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, no, Miss Rachel,” said Pinkie, in
surprise. “But then, mother never lets us do
any of the things you let Dick and Dolly do.
We haven’t any garden or arbour or Lady Eliza
or playhouse——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this, both Pinkie and Dolly began to cry
afresh, for they remembered that now Dolly
had no playhouse either! That beautiful house
and barn and lawn and ponds,—all a mass of
black, smoking ruins!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly flew to her Aunt Rachel and buried
her head on her broad, comforting shoulder as
she sobbed out her woe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Auntie,” she wailed; “isn’t it dreadful!
Those lovely little beds and bureaus, and the
dolls Aunt Nine dressed,—and the looking-glass
lake, and that little spotted pig,—he was <span class='it'>so</span>
cunning,—and the gilt clock in the parlour,—oh—ooh—o-o-ooh!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There, dearie, there, there,——” soothed
Miss Rachel, wondering whether Aunt Nine
would think Dolly ought to be punished, and
if so, what for.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wasn’t naughty, was I, Auntie?” went on
Dolly, between her sobs. “I wouldn’t be so
naughty as to burn up my dear playhouse on
purpose!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course you didn’t do it on purpose, dear;
and I don’t believe you were really naughty.
But never mind that, now. Even if you were,
you’re punished enough by the loss of the playhouse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I think I am. We were having <span class='it'>such</span>
fun, Pinkie and I. And, Auntie, it wasn’t a bit
Pinkie’s fault either. We wouldn’t either of
us have thought of making a fire, if you hadn’t
said we could. I mean, you said you used to
do it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Dolly, dear; I fully realise how it all
happened, and I’m not going to blame either
you or Phyllis. I think you should have known
it was a dangerous pastime, but if you’ll promise
never to play with fire or matches again, we’ll
count this affair merely as an accident. But it
was a pretty bad accident, and I’m very thankful
that only the playhouse was burned. I shudder
to think what might have happened to you
two little girls!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And to the whole house!” said Miss Abbie.
“If Dick hadn’t heard you scream, and if
Michael and Pat hadn’t been at home, we might
have no roof over our heads now!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Phyllis and Jack went home, and the
others went up to the playroom, to see what was
left in the ruins. Michael and Pat were still
cleaning up, but the whole room had been more
or less affected by the smoke, if not by the flame.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rug, being a thick, Oriental one, had
not suffered much, but the wallpaper and woodwork
were sadly marred, the curtains were a
wreck, and the furniture was scratched and
broken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As to the playhouse, the actual framework
was fairly intact, except where the dining-room
had been burned away, but it was blackened and
charred everywhere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Rachel directed the men to take it to
the cellar, and leave it there for the present.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sometime,” she said, “we may have it rebuilt
and re-decorated, but I can’t seem to think
about it just now. Do you want to keep any
of these things, Dolly?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly looked over the half-burned toys that
Dick and Jack had picked out of the ruins, and
more tears came as she recognised what had been
the blue satin sofa, and the baby’s crib.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I don’t want them,” she said; “they
only make me feel worse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then they found the little stove, that had
been the immediate cause of the catastrophe.
It was unharmed, except that it looked dull instead
of shiny, as before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think you’d better set this on the mantel,
Dolly,” said Aunt Abbie, “to remind you not
to play with fire.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll never play with fire again, Auntie,” said
Dolly. “But I will put it on the mantel, to
remind me of my dear playhouse. Oh, I did
love it so!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly had a great fondness for all her
belongings, and the playhouse, with its myriad
delights was her dearest and best beloved
possession.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s too bad, Dollums,” said Dick. “If
Aunt Rachel ever does decide to have the house
done over, I’ll do the yard all over again for
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An’ I’ll make yez a new barn,” said Michael,
who was just removing the burned remnants of
the old one; “but I can’t be doin’ it this summer;
there’s too much other wurrk. Next winter,
when the wurrk is lighter, I’ll have a thry
at it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And none of them felt like doing right over
again the work they had done so recently, so
the burned-out cottage was put in the cellar,
and stayed there for a long time. The playroom
itself had to be done over at once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A carpenter had to come first, and replace the
burned window sill, where the curtains had
blazed up; then the paper-hangers and painters;
so that it was several weeks before the room
could be used.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meantime, Dick and Dolly played out in
their out-of-doors playground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was now late in May, and the flowering
vines had almost covered the long arbour, making
a delightful place to sit and read, or make
things at the table. The twins loved to make
things, and often they thought they’d make furniture
for the renovated playhouse, but it’s hard
to do things so far ahead, and so they didn’t
get at it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fortunately Lady Eliza had been on the other
side of the playroom during the fire, so had escaped
without even a scorch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Dick and Dolly played she was a great
heroine, and often congratulated her on her
narrow escape from the fearful conflagration.
They never grew tired of Lady Eliza. She was
useful for so many games, and all the children
who visited the twins learned to look upon
Eliza as one of their own crowd.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s have a party for Eliza,” said Dolly,
one day, as she and Dick were working in their
gardens. “Oh, Dick, there’s a thrush! Sh!
don’t frighten him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Silently the children watched, as a thrush
perched on a nearby branch, and sang his best
musical selection. There is more sentiment in
a thrush’s song than in that of any other of
our birds, and though the twins didn’t recognise
exactly that fact, they loved to listen to the
thrush.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was their habit, after carefully watching a
bird, to look it up in their big, illustrated “Birds
of North America,” and learn its name and
habits.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s a Hermit Thrush,” whispered Dolly.
“See the lots of spots on his chest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe,” said Dick, softly; “but I think
it’s the Olive-Backed Thrush. See how brown
his back and tail are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, perhaps it is. Listen to his call,—he
says ‘Whee-oo! Too-whee!’ We must look him
up to make sure. Oh, there comes a robin after
him! Now they’ll fight!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go ’way, you horrid thing!” called Dick
to the big, fat Robin Redbreast, but unheeding,
the robin flew at the thrush, and bothered him,
until the thrush flew away, and Dick and Dolly
saw it no more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think it’s too bad robins are so cross,”
said Dolly, “and they’re so pretty, too. I’d
love them, if they wouldn’t pick-peck at the
other birds.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are horrid,” said Dick; “but if we
didn’t have robins, we wouldn’t have much of
anything. There are so few of the other birds,—’ceptin’
sparrows.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s so; well, as I was saying before
the thrush came, let’s give Lady Eliza a
party.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s ask Aunt Rachel first,” said Dick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The twins were learning to ask permission
beforehand, when they planned anything out of
the ordinary. This had already saved them
trouble, and the aunts were already congratulating
themselves that the children were learning
to “think.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, we will. But don’t let’s go in now.
Let’s plan it, and then we’ll ask auntie before
we really do anything about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, who’ll we invite?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s ’cordin’ how big the party is. If
Auntie Rachel ’grees, let’s have a big party,
’bout a dozen, you know. And if she thinks
bestest, we’ll only have Pinkie and Jack.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what’ll make it Eliza’s party?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, we’ll ask each child to bring a doll
or something, so’s to be comp’ny for her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Boys can’t bring dolls.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know; I’m thinking. Well, the boys can
bring Teddy bears, or rocking horses or anything
that isn’t alive, and that part of it’ll be
’Liza’s party, and the people part will be
ours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sounds good enough. Where’ll we have
it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here, of course; in the playground. We’ll
fix it all up partified, and have Japanese lanterns
and everything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We can’t have ’em lighted. It’ll have to
be a daytime party.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know. Maybe auntie will let us
have it ‘four to seven.’ We can light the
lanterns by six. It’s ’most dark then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right. Let’s go ask her now, ’fore we
plan any further. It’d be horrid to get it all
fixed up and then have her say ‘No.’”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The twins clasped hands and ran toward the
house. Dolly’s golden tangle of curls bobbed
up and down in the breeze, and Dick’s dark
ringlets clustered tighter on his brow, as his face
flushed with the exercise, but they ran evenly
and swiftly together, keeping perfect step as
they flew over the ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bang! In at the library door they went, and
tumbled upon Aunt Rachel, who sat in her usual
chair, placidly holding her hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Auntie, may we——” gasped Dick,
and, “Oh, Auntie, the loveliest plan!” panted
Dolly, when <a id='they'></a>they suddenly realised their aunt
was not alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A lady was calling, a lady very much dressed
up and formal-looking, who eyed the children
with some severity and much curiosity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Dick and Dolly had not proved dull
pupils in the matter of etiquette as taught in
Heatherton households. By no means. As
quickly as a soldier stands “at attention,” they
stood up straight, advanced decorously to the
lady, and Dolly made her most careful courtesy,
while Dick bowed correctly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you do, Mrs. Witherbee?” they
said, in decorous tones, and though they were
flushed and warm from their run, and just the
least mite out of breath, they reflected no discredit
on their aunts by boisterous or informal
behaviour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aunt Rachel and Aunt Abbie sat proudly
watching them, silently grateful for the twins’
exhibition of good manners, for Heatherton
matrons were critical of other people’s children,
and Mrs. Witherbee was one of the most particular
of all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You may go,” said Aunt Rachel to the
twins, after they had been duly questioned by
the visitor, and with proper ceremonies of farewell,
the twins noiselessly left the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I ’spect we behaved all right that
time,” said Dick, as they strolled back to the
garden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I promised Aunt Rachel I’d ’member
my manners carefuller ’n ever. She does love
to have us be polite.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know it; and it isn’t much trouble, after
you get used to it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It seemed as if Mrs. Witherbee never would
finish her call, but it was really only about ten
minutes later, when the twins saw her carriage
drive away. Again they raced to the house,
this time to find the aunties alone and expecting
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, what’s it all about?” said Miss
Abbie, after both ladies had been treated to a
fine demonstration of regard and esteem.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, we want to have a party,” began
Dick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For Lady Eliza,” broke in Dolly; “she’s
never had a party, and she’d just love one.
How many do you think we’d better ask?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A party! For Eliza!” said Aunt Rachel,
helplessly. “What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, a party. Girls and boys, you know,
and Teddy Bears, and dolls, and everybody bring
something.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bring something! to eat?” exclaimed Aunt
Abbie, in dismay, for it sounded like a general
picnic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no, not to eat!” explained Dolly; “but
to be company for Eliza, ’cause it’s her party.
And if you say so, we’ll only have Pinkie and
Jack, but we’d like to have more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell us about it more slowly,” suggested
Aunt Abbie; “and don’t both talk at once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You tell, Dick,” said Dolly. “You can
talk slower ’n I can.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said Dick, “we thought it would
be fun to have a party of about a dozen boys
and girls, but have it for Lady Eliza’s party,—just
for fun, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what’s this about bears?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; have each boy and girl bring a doll or
a bear, or a hobby horse or a Jack-in-the-box,
or anything like that, so it will be Eliza’s party
too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I begin to see,” said Aunt Rachel. “I
like the party idea; I’ve been thinking you children
might have a little party. But the Eliza
part of it is crazy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no, it isn’t, Auntie,” said Dolly, who
was patting her aunt on both cheeks as she
talked. “You see, all the boys and girls love
Lady Eliza ’most as much as we do. And
they’d be glad to have it be her party, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, we’ll have to talk it over, and see
about it,” said Miss Rachel; “but now it’s time
for you to run and get ready for tea.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, Auntie. But <span class='it'>do</span> decide soon, for
Eliza is <span class='it'>so</span> impatient to know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell her she’ll have to wait, Dolly. But
I’ll let her know by to-morrow, if that will do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Auntie, that will do, I’m sure;” and
with a final pat and a kiss, Dolly skipped away.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;font-size:1em;'>THE BIG CHIEF</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'>A</span>fter further discussion, and some coaxing
on the part of the twins, Miss
Rachel decided that the party, though
of course for Dick and Dolly, might be nominally
for Lady Eliza. And so they made up
an invitation like this, and Miss Abbie wrote
them in her neat hand:</p>

<div class='lgc' style=''> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>Miss Dolly Dana</p>
<p class='line'>Master Dick Dana</p>
<p class='line'>and</p>
<p class='line'>Lady Eliza Dusenbury</p>
<p class='line'>request the pleasure of</p>
<p class='line'>Miss Phyllis Middleton’s</p>
<p class='line'>company</p>
<p class='line'>on Thursday afternoon</p>
<p class='line'>from four to seven o’clock</p>
<p class='line'>at Dana Dene.</p>
<p class='line'>You are invited to bring a friend whose</p>
<p class='line'>company will be congenial to</p>
<p class='line'>the Lady Eliza.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>“Aren’t they the greatest ever!” exclaimed
Dick, dancing about the table where Aunt Abbie
was writing the notes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I doubt if those who are invited will
know what that last clause means,” said Aunt
Abbie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, they will, for we’ll tell them,” said
Dolly. “Of course we’ll see them all between
now and the party. There’s a whole week, you
know. I’ll tell every one to bring a doll or
something for Eliza’s part of the party. And
she must have a new dress, auntie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; something gay and festive, of course.
What would you like?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pink tarlatan,” said Dolly, promptly.
“With lots of ruffles, and a lace bertha, and a
pink sash, and let her wear my pink coral beads.
Oh, Auntie! won’t she look just sweet!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And flowers in her hair,” chimed in Dick;
“and a big, big bouquet, in her hand. Whew!
She’ll be a stunner!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As tarlatan was an inexpensive material, and
easy to make up, Aunt Abbie humoured Dolly’s
whim, and Lady Eliza had a beautiful new
frock for the occasion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dolly herself picked out just the right shade
of watermelon pink, and she helped a little, too,
gathering flounces, and running up breadths, but
Aunt Abbie made most of the pretty gown, and
it didn’t take very long either.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was to be worn over one of Aunt Abbie’s
own lace-trimmed petticoats, and two whole
days before the party, Eliza was dressed and
set away in the guest room to await the hour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe I’ll send an invitation to Aunt
Nine,” said Dolly, as they were making out
the list of those who were to be invited. “I
don’t s’pose she could come, but I think it
would be nice to ask her, don’t you, Aunt
Rachel?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, yes, dear; send one, if you like.
Though, as you say, of course she won’t come,
yet I think she’ll appreciate your thought of
her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So one invitation was sent to Miss Penninah
Dana, and twelve more were sent to boys and
girls in Heatherton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Every one of the dozen accepted, and after
conversation on the subject with Dick and Dolly,
they quite understood about the extra guests
they were to bring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But they were very secret about them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I won’t tell you,” said Jack Fuller, giggling,
“but I’m going to bring the funniest person you
ever saw! Oh, I know Lady Eliza will be
pleased!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Pinkie declared that her guest would be
the “belle of the ball.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>All these secrets greatly whetted the twins’
curiosity, and they could think of nothing but
the coming party. A few days before the event
they received a letter from Aunt Penninah, expressing
her regret that she could not be with
them. In it was also a letter addressed to
Lady Eliza Dusenbury. Chuckling with glee,
the twins tore it open and read:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='line' style='text-align:left;margin-left:0em;'>“<span class='sc'>Lady Eliza Dusenbury</span>:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Most charming and beautiful lady, I salute
you. To your party I come, and there with
you at Dana Dene will I ever after remain.
As your friend and protector I will stand ever
by your side. Unless, however, you should
attack me with a carving knife (as is sometimes
your playful habit), in which case, I will run
away and never return. Expect me on Thursday,
by express. Your true friend,</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:2em;'>“<span class='sc'>Saskatchewan</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” cried Dick, “it’s an Indian doll!
Saskatchewan is an Indian name, you know.
Won’t it be fun?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” cried his twin. “And do you suppose
<a id='aunt'></a>Aunt Nine dressed it herself, in wigwam and
feathers?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ho, ho! Dolly. You mean wampum, not
wigwam!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it’s all the same; I don’t care. Oh,
I wish Saskatchewan would come. I’m crazy
to see him!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So’m I. Do you s’pose the box’ll come
addressed to Lady Eliza Dusenbury, Dana
Dene?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I guess it’ll be addressed to Aunt
Rachel, or maybe to us. What does Dene
mean, auntie?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dene?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Dana Dene, you know?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Dana Dene is the name of our place,
you know. Not only the house, but the whole
estate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes’m; I know it. But what does Dene
mean? Just as a word?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, well, it doesn’t mean anything nowadays,
just as a word. But in old times, long
ago, it meant den or cave.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, this house isn’t a cave.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Miss Rachel, laughing. “We’re
not cave-dwellers. But long ago, there was
another house where this stands now. You
know, this estate has been in our family for
many generations.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And was the other house a cave?” asked
Dick, with vague visions of primitive ancestors
floating through his mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, of course not! The name cave came
from the fact that there was a deep den or cave
somewhere on the place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know, Dicky. It may be only
tradition, or there may have been a real
cave, now filled up or covered over. I
suppose it is in the woodland part, if it’s
anywhere.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it must be somewhere, Aunt Rachel,”
persisted Dick. “If they, my great-grand-fathers,
I mean, named the place Dana Dene
because of a big den, the den must be here
yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, perhaps it is, child, but it hasn’t been
seen or heard of for many years, anyway. You
may hunt for it, if you like, but I doubt if you’ll
find it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on Dollums,” cried Dick, jumping
up. “Let’s go and look for it. It would be
lots of fun if we could find it in time for the
party!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed it would not!” returned their aunt.
“Find it if you want to, but don’t play in it
on the day of the party. I’d like you to keep
yourselves tidy on that occasion, and not go
burrowing in caves. But I’ve no idea you’ll
find it. For, a cave that hasn’t been used for
over a hundred years, is likely to be filled up with
earth and leaves. It has, probably, entirely
disappeared.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, we’ll have the fun of hunting,” said
Dick, and away went the twins on their new
quest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Michael and Pat were first interviewed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you ever see a cave or a den anywhere
about the place?” they inquired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cave, is it?” said Michael. “Faith an’ I
didn’t. Whativer are yez up to now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, think!” cried Dick, impatiently.
“Didn’t you see one, Pat, when you were mowing
the grass, or anything like that? Digging,
you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did not. There’s no cave around these
diggin’s, unless so be it’s in the woods. There
may be a dozen caves in thim six acres of woodland.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The twins were disappointed. It seemed a
forlorn hope to try to investigate six acres of
doubtful territory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But do yez go and look,” said Michael.
“It’s jist what ye need to use up yer extry
energy. Yer so cockylorum about yer party,
that ye need a scape valve fer yer overflowin’
sperrits. Go, now, an’ hunt yer cave.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on, Dolly,” said Dick. “We can’t
do anything for the party, there’s nothing for
us to do. So we may as well go to the
woods.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right. I’d just as lieve go, and if the
cave is there, I should think we’d see it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Av coorse ye will,” said Michael, grinning.
“First, ye’ll see a signboard, wid a finger
pointien’ ‘This way to the Big Cave,’ thin ye
go right along to the entrance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An’ pay yer quarter to the gateman, an’
walk in,” supplemented Pat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The twins never minded the good-natured
chaff of these two Irishmen, and they only
laughed, as hand in hand they trotted
away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had been often to the wood, but heretofore
they had noticed only the trees and the
stones and the low-growing vegetation. Now
they carefully examined the formation of the
ground, and any suspicious-looking hollow or
mound.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe it was a smuggler’s cave,” said Dick,
“and in it perhaps are lots of things they
smuggled and hid away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I s’pect so,” said Dolly, who was of
an amiable nature, and quite willing to agree
with Dick’s opinions, whenever she had no
knowledge to the contrary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Or maybe it’s a fairy cave,” she added.
“That would be more likely, ’cause I think
these are awful fairyish woods.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why do you? You’ve never seen a fairy
in ’em.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, but I ’most have. I’ve seen lots of
places where they come out and dance at night.
Pinkie shows ’em to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pooh, she doesn’t know for sure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, not for sure. Nobody does. But she
says most prob’ly that’s where they dance. Do
fairies ever live in caves, Dick?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not ’zactly fairies. But dwarfs do, and
gnomes and things like that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sprites?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I guess so. And brownies,—real
brownies, I mean; not the picture-book kind.
Hello, Doll, here’s a place that looks cavy!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dick paused before a rough mass of soil and
stones and mossy overgrowth, that did seem to
bear some resemblance to the blocked-up mouth
of a cave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it was just as much like a mere natural
formation of ground, and after digging and
poking around with sticks, the children concluded
it was not a cave, after all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, pshaw, we’ll never find a real cave,
Dick; let’s go home. I’m getting hungry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So’m I. We can come back and hunt some
other time. Aunt Rachel wouldn’t let us play
in it on party day, anyway.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So back they went, and no one seemed surprised
that they hadn’t discovered a long-forgotten
cave, perhaps full of hidden treasure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The day before the party, Aunt Rachel and
Aunt Abbie drove to town to order the feast
from the caterer’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The twins accompanied them, for the selection
of the goodies was to be partly left to their
choice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The caterer’s was a fascinating place, and
Dick and Dolly exercised great care and
discretion in choosing the prettiest forms
for the ices, and the loveliest kinds of little
fancy cakes, and the gayest sort of snapping
crackers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sandwiches and lemonade would be made
at home, but all the rest of the feast must be
ordered, and Dick and Dolly were overwhelmed
with delight, as the aunties kept on adding bonbons,
fruits, nuts, and all sorts of delectable
things to the long list.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We never had such lovely parties at Auntie
Helen’s,” said Dick, reminiscently, as they drove
home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We never had a real party there, anyway,”
rejoined Dilly; “just only little play-teas of an
afternoon. This is different.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Miss Rachel, complacently, “this
is a real party. It will be one of the prettiest
children’s parties ever given in Heatherton.
That is, if your foolish Eliza performance
doesn’t spoil it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, that won’t spoil it, auntie,” said Dolly,
confidently; “that will only make it nicer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure!” said Dick. “Just a boys’ and girls’
party wouldn’t be near so much fun. Why,
Auntie, Bob Hollister says he’s going to bring
his Punch and Judy, and Lucy Hollister has an
awful big rag doll she’s going to bring.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think it will be funny,” said Aunt Abbie.
“But you must leave all those creatures out
in the playground when you come in to
supper.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes’m, we will,” agreed the twins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The very morning of the party day an immense
box came by express.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shure, it’s a big sofy, like your aunts has
in the droring-room,” said Michael, as he and
Pat helped the expressman to take it from the
wagon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, it’s Saskatchewan!” shrieked Dick and
Dolly, as they danced round the box in glee.
“Open it, Michael; oh, do hurry up!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Arrah, now, wait till I can get me sledgehammer,”
and Michael went to the tool-house
for his strongest tools.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But after some diligent prying and hammering,
the box was opened, and buried in a nest
of old newspaper and excelsior, was “Big Chief
Saskatchewan,” as a card tied to his wrist announced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And if you please, instead of an Indian <span class='it'>doll</span>,
he was a big wooden Indian, of the kind that
stands out in front of cigar stores. The children
screamed with glee, and even Michael and
Pat exclaimed in admiration as the heavy figure
was finally set upright on his own wheeled
pedestal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where do you suppose she ever got it?”
said Aunt Rachel, as the two aunts came out
to view the new arrival.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know, I’m sure,” said Miss Abbie,
“but he does make a fine companion for Lady
Eliza.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Saskatchewan, though a trifle weather-worn,
was not marred or broken, and the bundle of
cigars had been cut away from his hand, and
instead, he held an Indian basket. But this was
removable, and the twins saw at once that they
could put anything into his outstretched hand,
from a tomahawk to a pipe of peace. His
blanket wrapped round him was painted gorgeous
red and yellow, and high-standing feathers
surmounted his noble brow. His expression was
ferocious, but that was Indian nature, and Dick
and Dolly were so delighted with their new
toy, that they embraced him with the same vigorous
affection they often showed their aunts.
Then, clasping hands with the aunties, the four
danced round Saskatchewan and bade him welcome
to Dana Dene.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Indian was too heavy to be moved around
much though he could be dragged, owing to the
casters on the pedestal. But Aunt Rachel said
she thought he’d better be placed in the playground
as a permanent inhabitant thereof. For
wind and weather would not hurt him, as it
would the more delicate Lady Eliza.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Michael and Pat trundled the chief off
to the playground, followed by the admiring
family.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was given a choice position in a pleasant
corner, and the twins said they would build a
bower over him some day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But we must make it big enough for two,”
said Dolly, “so Lady Eliza can stand beside
him to receive their guests.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” agreed Dick. “But I wish we
could have it for this afternoon. They’d look
lovely under a bower.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So ye shall, thin,” said Michael. “Me an’
Pat, we’ll fix ye up a timporary bower, that’ll
gladden the eyes of ye,—that we will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So, the two kind-hearted men, anxious to
please the children, hastily erected a “bower”
by making an arch of two-foot width “chicken-wire.”
This, when decorated with vines and
flowers, was as pretty a bower as one would
wish to see, and Saskatchewan was placed beneath
it, or rather the bower was built over the
Indian, where he stood awaiting the Lady Eliza.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;font-size:1em;'>A GAY PARTY</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'>A</span>fter dinner, the final preparations for
the party were made.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The day was perfect, bright with sunshine,
and not too warm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lady Eliza was taken out to the playground
and introduced to her new companion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her large blue eyes showed no especial emotion
as she was placed beside him, under the
bower, nor did Saskatchewan seem at all embarrassed
by the presence of the lovely lady.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliza, in her ruffled pink tarlatan, and wreath
of pink blossoms, was a charming creature indeed,
and she held gracefully a massive bouquet,
tied with pink ribbons, while her cavalier, held
his Indian basket, which had also been filled with
flowers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So entrancing were the pair, that Dick and
Dolly could scarcely leave them, to go and get
on their own party raiment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The playground, of course, had been specially
adorned for the occasion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Japanese lanterns hung from the trees, and
rugs were laid here and there, extra seats were
provided, and everything was decked with flowers
and made gay with flags and bunting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Truly, the Dana ladies knew how to arrange
a gala occasion, and this bade fair to be a fine
one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The twins at last scampered back to the house
to dress, and Dolly was beautifully arrayed in
a new white frock of fine muslin and a broad
Roman sash.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her curls were tied up with a Roman ribbon
to match, and white stockings and white slippers
completed her costume.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dick, too, had a new summer suit, and
the twins promised the aunties not to roll on the
grass or do anything naughty or ridiculous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know you mean to do just right,” said
Aunt Rachel, as she kissed the two beaming little
faces, “but you know, you ‘don’t think,’ and
then you cut up some absurd dido, that makes a
lot of trouble.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The twins vowed they <span class='it'>would</span> think, and they
would <span class='it'>not</span> “cut up didoes,” and then they
danced away to receive their guests, for it was
nearly four o’clock. Pinkie came first, of course.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She brought her biggest wax doll, which she
had dressed up as a fairy. The doll had a
spangled white tulle frock on, and gauzy wings,
and a gilt paper crown, sparkling with diamond-dust.
She carried a long gilt wand, and was
really a beautiful fairy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A row of seats had been placed for Lady
Eliza’s guests, and the fairy was the first to
be seated there. Jack Fuller came next, and
he brought a funny creature, which his mother
had fashioned for him out of a feather bolster.
She had tied a string about it to form a head,
and this, covered with a pillowcase, had features
worked in it with colored embroidery cotton.
Then the doll was dressed in a white dress of
Mrs. Fuller’s, and a huge frilled sunbonnet
adorned its head. Jack came, lugging his
somewhat unwieldy guest, and the bolster lady
was made to bow politely to Lady Eliza.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why! who’s that?” exclaimed Jack, looking
with admiration at the wooden Indian.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s Big Chief Saskatchewan,” announced
Dick, proudly. “He’s ours. Aunt Nine sent
him to us. Isn’t he great?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gorgeous!” assented Jack. “How do you
like Betty Bolster?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, she’s just lovely,” declared Dolly, kissing
Betty’s soft, white cheek. “Set her down
there, next to Pinkie’s fairy.” Then the other
children began to flock in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maddy Lester brought a big Teddy bear, with
a huge ribbon tied round his neck, and a bunch
of flowers held in his paw. He made profound
obeisance to Lady Eliza and her friend, and
then he was seated next to Betty Bolster.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Clifford Lester had a fine personage to introduce
as his guest. He had taken his father’s
clothes-tree, and on the top had fastened a
smiling mask and a wig made of curled hair.
This he had dressed up in some nondescript
garments, and though the strange-looking lady
could not sit down, she stood beautifully, and
seemed quite worthy of Lady Eliza’s approval.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One boy brought a rocking-horse, and one a
’possum.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roguish Lily Craig brought a Jack-in-the-box,
which she sprang in the very face of Lady Eliza
and the Big Chief, without, however, scaring
them a mite.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Punch and Judy, too, created great
amusement, and Spencer Nash raised shouts of
laughter, when he arrived, proudly carrying a
scarecrow from his father’s cornfield.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This scarecrow was of the conventional type,
with flapping coat tails, and old, soft felt hat,
jammed down over his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When all had arrived, the fourteen children
were in gales of merriment at the strange collection
of creatures that made up Lady Eliza’s
part of the party, and they made a procession
to march round the grounds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Saskatchewan was too heavy to travel, so they
left him standing guard, but took lovely Lady
Eliza, who was easily carried by two of the boys.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The reviewing stand was the front veranda,
where the two aunties sat, and greatly did they
enjoy the parade that came rollicking, frolicking
by.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the guests, both animate and inanimate,
went into the big parlour for a dance. Aunt
Abbie played the piano, and though some of
the children had been to dancing school, many
had not, and the dance was really more of a
frolic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The scarecrow, carried by Spencer Nash, politely
asked Lady Eliza to be his partner, and
Dolly, in behalf of the lady, consented. So
these two, assisted by Spencer and Dolly, took
their places, and opposite them were the clothes-tree
lady and the big Teddy bear, each guided
in their steps by their laughing owners.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bolster Betty was partner to Jack-in-the-box,
and the fairy danced with the ’possum.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aunt Rachel guided the uncertain figures of
this quadrille, and the others all danced round
as they chose. Then, fearing the new member
of the Dana family would be lonesome, they all
trooped back to the playground, where Saskatchewan
stood, meekly holding his basket of flowers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You dear old thing!” cried Dolly, throwing
her arms round him. “Did we leave you all
alone? Well, here we are back again, and now
we’ll play with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So they played “Copenhagen,” and “Oats,
Peas, Beans, and Barley Grows,” and as Lady
Eliza’s guests were chosen to step inside the
ring, their absurd appearance made uproarious
fun and laughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, by way of quieting them down, Aunt
Abbie suggested that all the dolls and bears be
set aside, while the children played some games
by themselves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So, ranged in a semicircle, the queer guests
sat or stood on either side of Lady Eliza’s
bower, and the children grouped themselves on
the rugs on the ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>First, Aunt Abbie read them one or two
lovely stories, and then she proposed some guessing
games and some forfeit games, and it was
six o’clock before they knew it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So then it was time for the feast, and, leaving
Lady Eliza and the Big Chief to entertain their
guests, Dick and Dolly led their own guests to
the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dining-room table, extended to its full
length, was a gay and festive sight. In the
centre was a big pyramid, built of macaroons
and fancy cakes and bonbons, and surmounted
by a sugar Cupid holding a big red balloon by its
string.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At every plate was a little sugar figure, bird
or animal, holding the string of a red balloon,
and the balloons, themselves bobbing above the
table, made a jolly effect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two aunties assisted Delia and Hannah
to wait on the guests, whose appetites proved
to be of the normal nine-year-old variety. Sandwiches
disappeared as if by magic; chicken croquettes
seemed to meet with general approval,
and lemonade was willingly accepted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the ice cream came, in the various shapes
that Dick and Dolly had selected,—a different
design for each one. Pinkie had a fairy, of
course. Jack Fuller, an automobile, because he
was so anxious for his father to get one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Spencer Nash had a fish, because he liked to
go fishing, and Maddy Lester a boat, because
she loved the water. Each had some appropriate
joke or allusion, and, as the fun was appreciated,
the ices were all the more enjoyed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cakes and bonbons followed, and, last of all,
the snapping German crackers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These each held a tissue paper cap, which
was donned by its owner, and Dolly’s little
Dutch bonnet proved becoming to her rosy face
and sunny curls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pinkie’s was a crown, and after it was put in
place, Aunt Rachel declared she looked like a
fairy herself. The boys had sailor caps, and
soldier caps, and Scotch caps, and when all were
be-hatted, they adjourned to the parlour for
a final game.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This proved to be “Stick and Ball.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the middle of the wide arched doorway
hung, suspended by a single cord, a large ball,
apparently of white paper. A long, light stick
or wand, was supplied by Aunt Abbie, who then
blindfolded one of the little girls, and asked her
to take the wand, turn round three times, and
then hit at the ball.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Geraldine did so, but by the time she had
turned three times, she was standing almost with
her back toward the ball, though she didn’t know
it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So, when she struck, she hit only empty air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A shout of laughter arose, but the children
were surprised to find, as one after another tried
it, that it was far from easy, to turn three times,
and then stand facing in the right direction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So it was not until nearly all had attempted it,
that at last one of the boys hit the ball a smart,
sharp, <span class='it'>whack!</span> which burst the paper, and down
tumbled a lot of neat white paper parcels tied
with red ribbons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A name was written on each, and as the children
scrambled for them, they were quickly exchanged
until each had his or her own. The
parcels contained pretty little gifts which were
souvenirs of the party to take home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Though not of great value, they were all attractive
presents, and the young guests were
greatly pleased.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The party was over now, except for one last
visit to the playground to recover their dolls
and strange creatures who still waited out there.
But as they neared the spot, a delighted “Oh!”
burst from the children.</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='party'></a>Michael had lighted the Japanese lanterns
and turned the place into what looked like fairy-land.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was dark now, and the lanterns cast
shadows of Lady Eliza and her guests, as well
as of the trees and hedges.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t it beautiful!” whispered Pinkie to
Dolly. “I wish we could stay here awhile.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We can’t,” returned Dolly. “Aunt Rachel
says it’s too damp to stay out here in the evening.
So she just let us have the lanterns lighted
for a few minutes to see how pretty it is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s lovely!” declared everybody.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Dick said, “Perhaps in summer, when
it’s real warm, we can stay out here after dark,
and have the lanterns again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The twins put this question to Aunt Rachel,
after all the party guests had gone home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps,” she replied, “when it’s really
warm weather. But now, you must scurry to
bed, and we’ll discuss the subject some other
time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But we must bring in Lady Eliza,” said
Dick, and with Michael’s help, Lady Eliza,
with her pretty pink frock and ribbons quite unharmed,
came smilingly in at the front door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Big Chief Saskatchewan stood grimly on
guard, all through the night, looking steadily
ahead at the stars just above the horizon, and
holding firmly his Indian basket of gay blossoms.</p>

<h3>Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with

  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
